<div class="slide__description">Branch links even work when a user doesn’t have your app installed. In that case, we’ll detect what devices they’re using, take them to the appropriate app store, and then direct them to the link’s destination point, as soon as they download. Instead of landing on generic welcome screens post-download, your new users will end up exactly where they wanted to go.
