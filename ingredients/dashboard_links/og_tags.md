#### Social Media (OG) tags (optional but highly recommended)

While our [URL Creation Guide](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Branch-Integration-Guides/blob/master/url-creation-guide.md#dashboard-customizations) details how to set the default social media tags that will be used app-wide, you can customize these on a per-link basis as well.

For more information on the optimal format for the title and description, see Facebook's [Sharing Best Practices](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/best-practices#tags).
