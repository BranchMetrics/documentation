### {% section title %}Custom Redirects (Optional){%endsection%}

This allows you to direct the user to somewhere other than the App Store or Play Store if he does not have the app installed. This gives you flexibility as a marketer. You may decide for certain links that if they do not have the app, the user should be sent to www.yourwebsite.com/a_particular_campaign.

{%section description%}{%endsection%}

Note that these redirects only come into play if the user does *not* have the app installed.
