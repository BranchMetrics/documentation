### Tags: Channel, Campaign, Etc. (Optional -- highly recommended)

The more information you enter, the better you'll be able to segment data on the Dashboard and in exports. We recommend setting Channel and Campaign. Tags allow you to easily add tags that don't need to be categorized.

{% endsection %}

{% section deep_link_data_url %}{% endsection %}

*Hint: Press the 'comma' or 'return' key after each tag.*
