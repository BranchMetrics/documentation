#### Tags: Channel, Campaign, Etc. (highly recommended)

The more information you enter, the better you'll be able to segment data on the Dashboard and in exports. We recommend setting Channel and Campaign. Tags allows you to easily add tags that don't need to be categorized. For information of the form *[key]*: *[value]* such as "product": "shoes", we recommend adding them to "Deep Link Data (Advanced)", discussed below.

*Hint: Press the 'comma' or 'return' key after each tag.*
