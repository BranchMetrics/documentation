### Custom Link Label {% section optional %}(Optional){% endsection %}

You can customize how your link will appear--for free!

{% section explanation %}You should set this if users are going to see the link, whether on social media, in a text message, or in an email. It's less important if this link is going to be buried behind a button or picture on a web page. We think it's generally a good idea to set this, as users will often see your links.{% endsection %}
