## Install versus Open

We measure installs and opens separately: 

* An `install` is the very first time a user launches the app. 
* An `open` is any other time the user opens the app after the very first launch.

When you look at how your Branch links are performing, you can see how many are installs and opens they are driving. Don't be confused by the terminology: `install` is the first time the user accesses your app; every subsequent time the user enters your app is an `open` in our system.
