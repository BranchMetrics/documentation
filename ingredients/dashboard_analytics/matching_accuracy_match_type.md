### Match Type

If you are concerned that users may potentially have the same fingerprint, you can choose to have us not match users if two identical fingerprints are outstanding. On the Dashboard's [Link Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link) page, under advanced options, you should set Match Type.

This means that if two users with the same fingerprint, on the same wifi, were to click the link, we would blacklist that digital fingerprint for the expiration duration. Therefore, when they open up the app, no match would be made.
