### Match Type

If you are super concerned that users may potentially have the same fingerprint, you can choose to have us not match users if two identical fingerprints are outstanding. On the Dashboard's [Link Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link) page, under advanced options, you should set Match Type.
