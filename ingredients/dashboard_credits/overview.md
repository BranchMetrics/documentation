### Overview: Credits and Reward Rules

Branch allows you reward users with credits, track those credits, and redeem them when appropriate. It is a unit-less currency available to your users without you having to build a system from scratch.

Branch's credit system:

* allows you to define as many "virtual wallets" per user as you want. These are called `buckets` and if no bucket is specified, the `default` bucket is credited/debited.
* has built-in functions for rewarding, checking the balance, and redeeming credits.
* enables you to specify rewards dynamically using `Reward Rules` on the dashboard.
* comes with fraud protection built in.
