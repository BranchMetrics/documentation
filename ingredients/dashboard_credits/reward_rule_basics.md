### Reward Rule Basics

To award users for credits, you must set up a reward rule tied to a specific events.

Reward rules can be based on [TODO] [standard Branch-defined events]() like `install`, `open` and `referred session`. They can also be based on [TODO] [custom events]().

To add a rule, go to the Dashboard Referrals page and click the [Rules tab](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/referrals/rules). Click the green "+ Add a new rule" button.

These allow you to tailor:

* Who gets a reward
* How many credits the reward is
* Which `bucket` the credits go to
* Whether the reward occurs the first time or every time
* Which event triggers the reward
