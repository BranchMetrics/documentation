## "Always try to open the app"

By default, Branch will attempt to open up the app 100% of the time. On iOS9, this can cause an ugly error message if the app happens to not be installed. If you want to default sending the user to the App / Play Store unless Branch is sure the app is installed, you can uncheck this box.

You can see it in the screenshot below or on the [Link Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link) page.
