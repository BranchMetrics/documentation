### Web URL

Next, to configure the Web URL on an existing app, you will need to navigate to the Settings > [http://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link](Link Settings) page on the Dashboard. Scroll down to _Default URL_ and enter your website.

This is where we will take users who click a Branch link if we don't know where else to take them. For example, if you don't have an Android app released yet, Android users will be taken to this link. Don't forget to Save!

Tip: You can customize this fallback URL on a per-platform or even per-link basis. After completing setup, you may want to check out [TODO] [links-and-sharing.VIII-customizing-URL](http://example.com).
