Our dashboard is the starting point for tracking users of your app.

To get started, point your browser to [https://dashboard.branch.io/](https://dashboard.branch.io/). If you haven't created an account before, you can signup and get taken through the basic setup right away. If you've signed up already, simply navigate to the [Summary](https://dashboard.branch.io/#) page and click the dropdown button in the top right. Choose "Create new app." You will be prompted to enter a name for your new app. Do so and press "Create."
