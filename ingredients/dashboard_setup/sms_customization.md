There are two possibilities for the SMS messages. Either:

1) You can define a special message based on your own parameters in the *Deep Link Data* section at the bottom of the link editing screen.

Use the *key* of *custom\_sms\_text* and then enter your custom value in the value section. This will be added before your Branch link in the message.

2) The SMS will default to "Click to download here --" followed by your Branch link. If you wish to customize the default message, edit the message following the keyword *default* in the *Text me the app page*.
