To award users for credits, you must set up a reward rule tied to a specific events.

Reward rules can be based on [TODO] [standard Branch-defined events]() like _install_, _open_ and _referred session_. They can also be based on [TODO] [custom events]().

To add a rule, go to the Dashboard Referrals page and click the [Rules tab](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/referrals/rules). Click the green "+ Add a new rule" button.

These allow you to tailor:

1. Who gets a reward
1. How many credits the reward is
1. Which `bucket` the credits go to
1. Whether the reward occurs the first time or every time
1. Which event triggers the reward

While the following screen is a bit busy, it illustrates where you adjust these five toggles.
