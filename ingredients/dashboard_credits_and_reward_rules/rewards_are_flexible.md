#### Rewards are flexible

Branch’s credit system:

* is based on either Branch-provided events (_install_, _open_, and _referred session_) or any custom events you track with a `userCompletedAction:` call.
* allows you to define as many “virtual wallets” per user as you want. These are called buckets and if no bucket is specified, the default bucket is debited/credited.
* has built-in functions for rewarding, checking the balance, and redeeming credits.
* enables you to specify rewards dynamically using Reward Rules on the dashboard.
* comes with fraud protection built in.
