### Sharing Branch Links

These links can be shared anywhere -- via SMS, email, social media -- you name it. If you have existing sharing functionality in place, all you need to do is insert a Branch link.

If you don't have sharing in place and want to get up and running quickly, check out the [Sharing Methods](/domains/links_and_sharing/{{page.platform}}/#sharing) section of our [Links and Sharing](/domains/links_and_sharing/{{page.platform}}/) reference. We give you step-by-step instructions for sharing via SMS, email or social media.
