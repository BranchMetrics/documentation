When setting up a Google Adwords campaign there are three hierarchical levels involved where a Branch Ad link can be used for attribution and measurement. The broadest level is the **campaign level** which encompasses all ad groups that may be created under it as well as each individual ad that is involved in the campaign. The second level of granularity is the **ad group level** which encompasses all ads created as part of its group. Then the most specific unit is an **individual ad**.
