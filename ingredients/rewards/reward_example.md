Let's say you want to give 10 credits to each new user who signs up through a friend, and 5 credits to the friend who referred him or her. That can be done through a combination of (*two rules.*

#### Rule 1: Rewarding the Referred User (10 Credits)

{% image src='/img/ingredients/dashboard_credits_and_reward_rules/referred_rule.png' right half alt='reffered' %}

1. Who gets a reward: "Referred acting users"
2. How many credits the reward is: 10
3. Which bucket the credits go to: default
4. Whether the reward occurs the first time or every time: the first time
5. Which event triggers the reward: install


Be sure to press "Add rule"!

#### Rule 2: Rewarding the Referring User (5 Credits)

{% image src='/img/ingredients/dashboard_credits_and_reward_rules/referring_rule.png' right half alt='referring' %}

1. Who gets a reward: "Referring users"
2. How many credits the reward is: 5
3. Which bucket the credits go to: default
4. Whether the reward occurs the first time or every time: every time
5. Which event triggers the reward: install



<div class="full-width">After adding this second rule, you should see the following:</div>

That's it!
