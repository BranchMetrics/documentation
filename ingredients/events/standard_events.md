Branch automatically tracks *opens*, *installs*, *referred sessions* and *web session start*. You don't need to write any special code--as soon as you start initializing sessions and clicking on Branch links, these events are recorded.

You can easily see these events by navigating the Dashboard's Export page and clicking on [Events](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/export/events/view). 

These three events are tied to the initSession and handleOpenURL calls.
