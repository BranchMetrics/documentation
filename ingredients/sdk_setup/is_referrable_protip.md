{% protip title='Referral attribution after install'  %}
By default, users only get attribution for installs if the users they refer download the app for the first time. If users had the app, it doesn't "count." To override this behavior, check out the setting `isReferrable` [here](/domains/configuring_client_apps/{{page.platform}}/#isreferrable).
{% endprotip %}
