This section offers an overview of the power of the Dashboard. The Dashboard is your best friend. You can create links for marketing campaigns, see how your various links are performing, construct funnels using custom events, and export your valuable data. You can slice and dice the insights by campaign, channel (e.g. email, Facebook, Twitter, SMS, etc), feature (e.g. referrals vs. content shares), and any custom tags that you'd like. You can find out who your top influencers are; not just the users who are sharing the most links, but those who are driving actual installs. 

Note that to get insights on installs and custom events within the app--or really any insights beyond clicks data--a developer will have to follow the required steps in [18. dashboard configuration]() and [19. configuring client apps]().
