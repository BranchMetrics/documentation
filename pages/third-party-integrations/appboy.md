{% if page.overview %}

The Branch partnership with [Appboy](https://www.appboy.com) provides a push-button way to deliver Branch installs and attributions to your Appboy dashboard. This allows you to analyze your users coming in from Branch deep linked campaigns.

**At this time, our integration only applies to the iOS platform.**

## How it works

We have built a custom integration to automatically send all Branch install data to Appboy without any extra work on your side (besides integrating both SDKs). Simply click a button, and you'll be good to go!

{% protip title="How do we differentiate Appboy and Branch installs?" %}We rely on a Branch link being clicked, which leads to an install. This sets an internal boolean that an install came from Branch.{% endprotip %}

{% prerequisite %}

- This guide requires you to have already [integrated the Branch SDK]({{base.url}}/getting-started/sdk-integration-guide) into your app.
- You also need to [sign up for an Appboy account](https://dashboard.appboy.com/developers/sign_up) and [install the Appboy SDK](https://documentation.appboy.com/).
- Ensure Appboy's SDK is [collecting the IDFA](https://documentation.appboy.com/iOS/#optional-idfa-collection).

{% endprerequisite %}

## Get the Appboy API key

1. On the Appboy dashboard, navigate to the **App Settings** section, and click **3rd Party Integrations**.
1. From there, grab your API key (this will be the same for all attribution partners listed on the page).


## Configure the Branch Dashboard

1. On the Branch Dashboard (dashboard.branch.io), navigate to the [Integrations page](https://dashboard.branch.io/integrations).

## Troubleshooting

There are common strategies to take while trouble shooting.

### How to use Branch Links to Deep Link from Appboy's In-App Message Campaigns on iOS

1. Ensure that the type of campaign you are running is an **In-App Message** campaign.
2. From Appboy's Dashboard, **Edit** your campaign.
3. From the **Compose** tab scroll down to **iOS**.
4. Within the **On-click Behavior** section, select **Deep Link Into App**.
5. To understand what to insert into this field, find a Branch Marketing link you would like users to get deep linked to and then follow the instructions [here](https://dev.branch.io/features/facebook-ads/support/ios/#use-a-direct-deep-link).
6. **Update** your campaign.
7. The final step requires a code change. You'll have to modify `application:openURL:options:` so that it makes a call to:

{% highlight objc %}
[[Branch getInstance]
     application:application
     openURL:url
     options:options];
{% endhighlight %}

This will replace the call to:

{% highlight objc %}
[[Branch getInstance] handleDeepLink:url];
{% endhighlight %}

Here is the method correctly implemented:

{% highlight objc %}
- (BOOL) application:(UIApplication *)application
             openURL:(NSURL *)url
             options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options {
    
    [[Branch getInstance]
     application:application
     openURL:url
     options:options];
    
    return YES;
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Note**: This method is available in iOS SDK version `0.14.9` and higher.

Performing these changes will ensure that a tap on an **In-App Message** results in the delivery of deep link data from the link selected in **step 5**.
