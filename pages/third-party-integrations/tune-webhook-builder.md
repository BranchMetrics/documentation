## Configuring your Branch + Tune Webhooks ##

The purpose of this link generator tool is to help you to properly structure your Branch and Tune integrated deep links.

Use this link builder to create a postback URL, which you can then use to [create a new webhook in your Branch dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/webhook) to link your Branch and Tune accounts.
