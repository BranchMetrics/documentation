## Upload a Feed Source

To create a deep linked feed, you'll upload a raw data or product feed. This is called a **Feed Source**. 

When you need to create a **Deep Linked Feed** you'll go through a Deep Linked Feed creation flow that will ask you to select a Feed Source and how you'd like to modify it. 

Go directly to [Deep Linked Feeds](http://dashboard.branch.io/ads) in the Branch dashboard to get started.

1. Click on the "Feed Sources" tab at the top of the page.
1. Click the **Add New Feed Source** button to get started. {% image src='/img/pages/features/deep-linked-feeds/add-new-feed-source.png' full center alt='Add New Feed Source' %}
1. Name your Feed Source and upload it.

You can see all of the **Feed Sources** you've uploaded by going to the [Feed Sources](http://dashboard.branch.io/ads/feedsources) tab.

## Create a New Deep Linked Feed

To create a deep linked feed, you'll upload a raw data or product feed. This file is called a **Feed Source** in the interface.

When you want to create a **Deep Linked Feed** you'll go through a Deep Linked Feed creation flow that will ask you to select a Feed Source, and help you modify it. 

Go directly to [Deep Linked Feeds](http://dashboard.branch.io/ads) in the Branch dashboard to get started.

1. Click on the "Deep Linked Feeds" tab at the top of the page.
1. Click the **Add Deep Linked Feed** button. {% image src='/img/pages/features/deep-linked-feeds/add-deep-linked-feed.png' full center alt='Add Deep Linked Feed' %}

## Deep Linked Feed Creation Flow

1. If you need to upload a Feed Source, click the "Add New Feed Source" button. Upload the file you'd like turn into a Deep Linked Feed.
{% image src='/img/pages/features/deep-linked-feeds/add-new-feed-source-button-campaign-creation.png' half center alt='Add New Feed Source' %}
1. In "Deep Linked Feed Information" you'll name your Deep Linked Feed for reference, and specify which Feed Source you'd like to turn into a Deep Linked Feed. You'll also input the Ad Platform on which you'd like to run your campaigns. This information will be used to modify the feed and insert well-structured Branch attribution data into the links.
{% image src='/img/pages/features/deep-linked-feeds/dlf-step-1.png' half center alt='Deep Linked Feed Creation Step 1' %}
1. In "Create Deep Links" you'll be presented with two optional elements. The first is a list of column names from your feed source. To add deep link data to each link, select the column that contains the relevant data. 
  {% example %}
  Maybe you have a column in your product feed titled `id`. Let's say that column contains the product id for each piece of content, and that your app needs that id to deep link correctly. To create deep links with that id for each product, select the column by checking the box on the left hand side. If you'd like to change the name of the key (for example, from `id` to `product_id`) you can write the new name for the key in the text box on the right hand side. This will add the correct `product_id` to each link for every single product in your feed (e.g. the first item will have `"product_id":1392`, the second item will have `"product_id":5284`)!

1. "Validate and Test" will not be available in the Alpha version, but will include helpful steps for checking your feed and previewing its contents. Click "Save and Continue" to proceed.
1. In "Get Deep Linked Feed" you can download your feed! Once you get to the final step, you will see "Generating CSV..." Wait for this to finish, then click "Download CSV"Â when the button text changes.
