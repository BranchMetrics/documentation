There are a million and one ways to use Branch in your app! In this section, we get you up to speed on the basics of the Branch platform.

#### If this is your first visit...
- The **[SDK Integration Guide](sdk-integration-guide)** is a good place to begin. This covers what you need to get our mobile SDK integrated into your app, which is the foundation for everything else.

#### Next steps to take
- After integrating the SDK, you will want to enable **[Universal and App Links](universal-app-links)**, especially if your app contains an iOS version. **You must enable Universal Links before Branch can function correctly on iOS 9.2+!**
- The **[Creating Links in Apps](creating-links-in-apps)** page describes how to generate Branch links inside your app.
- **[Deep Link Routing](deep-link-routing)** allows you control what users see first after opening your app from a Branch link. It's a powerful feature you will want to enable.
