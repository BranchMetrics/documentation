{% if page.overview %}

iOS Universal Links and Android App Links both route directly to your app when opened, bypassing the web browser and URI scheme combination typically used for the redirection process. App Links were introduced with Android M, and enabling them results in a more seamless experience for your users. Universal Links were introduced with iOS 9, and became the only fully-functional deep linking option on iOS after [Apple stopped supporting URI schemes for deep linking in iOS 9.2](https://blog.branch.io/ios-9.2-redirection-update-uri-scheme-and-universal-links). 

{% caution title="Universal Links are critical on iOS!" %}
You must enable Universal Links before Branch can function correctly on iOS 9.2+{% endcaution %}

Branch makes it simple to enable Universal Links and App Links, and even improves on them since you also get all the other benefits of Branch links when the visitor does not yet have your app installed:

{% endprotip %}

### Add your Branch link domains

1. In the `Domains` section, click the `+` icon and add the following entry: `applinks:bnc.lt` {% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/universal-app-links/add_domain.png' 3-quarters center alt='xcode add domain' %}

{% protip title="Using a custom domain or subdomain?" %}
If you use a [custom domain or subdomain for your Branch links]({{base.url}}/getting-started/dashboard-guide/guide/#setting-a-custom-link-domain), you should also add an entry for `applinks:[mycustomdomainorsubdomain]`.
{% endprotip %}

### Add entitlements file to the build target

1. Select your `[projectname].entitlements` file in the Xcode navigator (left sidebar).
1. Ensure that the correct build target is checked in the right sidebar. {% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/universal-app-links/entitlements-build-target.png' half center alt='add entitlements to build target' %}

{% endif %}

{% if page.cordova %}

Add the following entry to your application's `config.xml`:

{% highlight xml %}
<branch-config>
    <ios-team-id value="your_ios_team_id" />
    <host name="bnc.lt" scheme="https" />
</branch-config>    
{% endhighlight %}

{% protip title="Notes" %}
- You can get your **iOS Team ID** from the Your Account page on the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/index.action#accountSummary).
- If you use a custom domain or subdomain for your Branch links, you should also add a key for `<host name="mycustomdomainorsubdomain" scheme="https" />`.
{% endprotip %}

{% endif %}

{% if page.xamarin %}

Create a new file named `Entitlements.plist` in the root directory of your project. Enable `associated-domains` and add `applinks:bnc.lt`.

{% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/universal-app-links/xamarin_branch_ios_domains.png' full center alt='Associated Domains' %}

{% protip title="Using a custom domain or subdomain?" %}
If you use a [custom domain or subdomain for your Branch links]({{base.url}}/getting-started/dashboard-guide/guide/#setting-a-custom-link-domain), you should also add an entry for `applinks:[mycustomdomainorsubdomain]`.
{% endprotip %}

{% endif %}

{% if page.titanium %}

1. Create a new file named `Entitlements.plist` in the same directory as your Titanium app's `tiapp.xml`
1. Insert the following snippet:

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.developer.associated-domains</key>
    <array>
        <string>applinks:bnc.lt</string>
    </array>
</dict>
</plist>
{% endhighlight %}

{% protip title="Using a custom domain or subdomain?" %}
If you use a [custom domain or subdomain for your Branch links]({{base.url}}/getting-started/dashboard-guide/guide/#setting-a-custom-link-domain), you should also add a key for `<string>[mycustomdomainorsubdomain]</string>`.
{% endprotip %}

#### Support Universal Links on Cold Start

Due to some certain limitations (at the time of writing), the module will not be able to handle data when clicking Universal Links while the app is not running at all. To solve this issue, you have to implement a listener to the 'continueactivity' on your Titanium app, retrieve the parameters and pass it to the module's `continueUserActivity` method. You can see an example of how this is implemented in [our testbed code](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Titanium-Deferred-Deep-Linking-SDK/blob/master/testbed/app/controllers/index.js#L86).

To implement, first add an entry to `NSUserActivityTypes` in your plist file.

{% highlight xml %}
<plist>
  <dict>
    ....
    <key>NSUserActivityTypes</key>
    <array>
      <string>io.branch.testbed.universalLink</string> // This is only a sample. Use reverse domain.
    </array>
  </dict>
</plist>
{% endhighlight %}

Now, before you call initSession, create a User Activity with the same name as you registered above and then add a listener to the event `continueactivity`. Note that the Universal Link data will be available in the initSession callback - this mechanism is just to work around a Titanium deficiency.

{% highlight js %}
if (OS_IOS) { // Don't forget this condition.
    var activity = Ti.App.iOS.createUserActivity({
        activityType:'io.branch.testbed.universalLink'
    });

    activity.becomeCurrent();

    Ti.App.iOS.addEventListener('continueactivity', function(e) {
        if (e.activityType === 'io.branch.testbed.universalLink') {
            branch.continueUserActivity(e.activityType, e.webpageURL, e.userInfo);
        }
    });
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Test your Universal Links implementation

After completing this guide and installing a new build of your app on your testing device, you can verify Universal Links are working correctly by following these steps:

1. [Create a new Marketing Link](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/marketing/new) on the Branch dashboard. Leave all configuration items at their default options.
1. Open this link on your testing device via Messages, Mail, Notes, or one of the other apps listed as **works** on [this page]({{base.url}}/getting-started/universal-app-links/support/#appsbrowsers-that-support-universal-links).
1. If successful, your app should launch immediately without routing through Safari. If not, please check the [Troubleshooting section]({{base.url}}/getting-started/universal-app-links/support/#troubleshooting-universal-links).

{% endif %}

{% if page.ios %}
<!-- do nothing -->
{% else %}

## Generate signing certificate fingerprint

{% if page.android %}
{% ingredient quickstart-prerequisite %}{% endingredient %}
{% else %}
{% protip %}
The following steps are only required if you wish you enable Android App Links. 
{% endprotip %}
{% endif %}

Start by generating a SHA256 fingerprint of your app's signing certificate. This is the file that you use to build the debug and production version of your APK file before deploying it.

1. Navigate to your keystore file.
1. Run this command on it to generate the fingerprint: `keytool -list -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore`
1. You'll see a value like `14:6D:E9:83:C5:73:06:50:D8:EE:B9:95:2F:34:FC:64:16:A0:83:42:E6:1D:BE:A8:8A:04:96:B2:3F:CF:44:E5` come out the other end. Copy this.

## Enable App Links on the Branch dashboard

1. Head to the [Link Settings page](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link) on the Branch dashboard.
1. Toggle the **Enable App Links** checkbox in the Android section.
1. Paste the copied fingerprint value into the **SHA256 Cert Fingerprints** field that appears. {% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/universal-app-links/enable_app_links.png' full center alt='enable app links' %}
1. Scroll down and click `Save`.
 
{% protip title="Using multiple fingerprints" %}
You can insert both your debug and production fingerprints for testing. Simply separate them with a comma.
{% endprotip %}

{% if page.cordova %}

## Configure project

Add the following entry to your application's `config.xml`:

{% highlight xml %}
<branch-config>
    <android-prefix value="READ_FROM_DASHBOARD" />
    <host name="bnc.lt" scheme="https" />
</branch-config>
{% endhighlight %}

{% protip title="Notes" %}
- If you enabled iOS Universal Links, some of these keys will already exist and should not be entered again.
- `READ_FROM_DASHBOARD` is the four-character value in front of all your links. You can find it underneath the field labeled **SHA256 Cert Fingerprints** on the dashboard. It will look something like this: `/WSuf` (the initial `/` character should be included).
- If you use a custom domain or subdomain for your Branch links, you should also add a key for `<host name="mycustomdomainorsubdomain" scheme="https" />`.
{% endprotip %}

{% else %}

## Add Intent Filter to Manifest

1. Choose the `Activity` you want to open up when a link is clicked. This is typically your `SplashActivity` or a `BaseActivity` that all other activities inherit from (and likely the same one you selected in the [SDK Integration Guide]({{base.url}}/getting-started/sdk-integration-guide)).
1. Inside your `AndroidManifest.xml`, locate where the selected `Activity` is defined.
1. Within the `Activity` definition, insert the intent filter provided below.
   - Replace `READ_FROM_DASHBOARD` with the value provided underneath the **SHA256 Cert Fingerprints** field on the Branch dashboard. It will look something like this: `android:pathPrefix="/WSuf"`

{% highlight xml %}
<!-- AppLink example -->
<intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="https" android:host="bnc.lt" android:pathPrefix="READ_FROM_DASHBOARD" />
</intent-filter>
{% endhighlight %}

{% protip title="Using a custom domain or subdomain?" %}
If you use a [custom domain or subdomain for your Branch links]({{base.url}}/getting-started/dashboard-guide/guide/#setting-a-custom-link-domain), you should also add an entry for:

{% highlight xml %}
<data android:scheme="https" android:host="mycustomdomainorsubdomain" android:pathPrefix="READ_FROM_DASHBOARD" />
{% endhighlight %}
{% endprotip %}

{% endif %}

## Test your App Links implementation

After completing this guide and installing a new build of your app on your testing device, you can verify App Links are working correctly by following these steps:

1. [Create a new Marketing Link](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/marketing/new) on the Branch dashboard. Leave all configuration items at their default options.
1. Open this link on your testing device.
1. If successful, your app should launch immediately without routing through the web browser or showing an **Open With...** dialog.

{% endif %}

## Next steps

Your Branch links are now configured to open your app in the most user-friendly way possible.

Here are some recommended next steps:

- **Learn about [Creating Links in Apps]({{base.url}}/getting-started/creating-links-in-apps)** â€” let your users share content and invite friends from inside your app.
- **Set up [Deep Link Routing]({{base.url}}/getting-started/deep-link-routing)** â€” send incoming visitors directly to specific content in your app based on the Branch link they opened.

## Using a custom domain or subdomain

### Custom SUBDOMAIN (go.branch.com)
1. Create a CNAME for the subdomain and point it to `custom.bnc.lt`
1. Go to [Link Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link) on the Branch dashboard, and find the **Custom Link Domain** section.
1. You should see a message telling you the status of your domain under the `Domain name` field. If you don't, please type your domain in again.
1. Click the `Save` button.

{% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/universal-app-links/custom-domain-success.png' full center alt='successful custom subdomain configuration' %}

### Custom ROOT domain (branch.com)

1. Follow [CloudFlare's instructions](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169046-How-do-I-add-a-CNAME-record-) to set up your root domain with a CNAME to `custom.bnc.lt`
1. Using the CloudFlare control panel, proxy your traffic to the domain `custom.bnc.lt` by clicking the cloud with the arrow to make it _orange_. {% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/universal-app-links/orange_cloud.png' full center alt='cloudflare TLS configuration' %}
1. Make your Crypto settings match this screenshot. This is done by enabling SSL. {% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/universal-app-links/ssl.png' 3-quarters center alt='cloudflare TLS' %}

## Custom continueUserActivity configuration

When users enter your app via a Universal Link, we check to see to see if the link URL contains `bnc.lt`. If so, `handledByBranch` will return `YES`. If not, `handledByBranch` will return `NO`. This allows us to explicitly confirm the incoming link is from Branch without making a server call.

For most implementations this will never be an issue, since your deep links will be routed correctly either way. However, if you use a custom link domain *and* you rely on `handledByBranch` to return `YES` for every incoming Branch-generated Universal Link, you can inform the Branch SDK by following these steps:

1. In your **Info.plist** file, create a new key called `branch_universal_link_domains`.
1. Add your custom domain(s) as a string. {% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/universal-app-links/branch-universal-link-domain.png' 3-quarters center alt='cloudflare TLS' %}
1. Save the file.

{% protip title="Multiple custom domains" %}
If you have an unusual situation with multiple custom link domains, you may also configure `branch_universal_link_domains` as an array of strings. {% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/universal-app-links/branch-universal-link-domains.png' 3-quarters center alt='cloudflare TLS' %}
{% endprotip %}

## How to handle old URI paths with Universal Links

When you make the move to Universal Links, you might be wondering how to best harness your old URI paths for iOS 9.X users while keeping the experience the same for iOS 8.X and lower. The easiest way is to handle each link type separately via a conditional flag (such as **self.ignoreDeeplinkPath**) in `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions:`.

### Non-Universal Links

The entry point for this link type is `application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation:`

1. In `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions:`, set the **self.ignoreDeeplinkPath** to `YES` (to ensure that users do not get deep linked twice).
1. Route users to the correct place in your app by harnessing the URL passed in as a parameter.

### Universal Links

The entry point for this link type is `application:continueUserActivity:restorationHandler:`

1. The default value of **self.ignoreDeeplinkPath** in `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions:` defaults to `NO`.
1. Harness the **$deeplink_path** key (set at the time of Branch link creation) to route users to the correct place in your App after Branch has finished initialization.

{% example title="Sample AppDelegate" %}

Here is a generic **AppDeledate.m** snippet with these methods implemented:

{% highlight objc %}

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

Branch *branch = [Branch getInstance];

   [branch initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {
      if (!error) {
         if (params[@"$deeplink_path"] && !self.ignoreDeeplinkPath) {
            NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"your-uri-scheme://%@", params[@"$deeplink_path"]]];
            // handle the URL!
            [self routeUrl:url];
         }
      }
      self.ignoreDeeplinkPath = NO;
   }];
   return YES;
}

//Entry point for iOS 8.X users and lower 

-(BOOL) application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {
   [[Branch getInstance] handleDeepLink:url];
   self.ignoreDeeplinkPath = YES;

   // ... your other logic here, such as ...
   [self routeUrl:url];

   return YES;
}

//Entry point for iOS 9.X users

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application continueUserActivity:(NSUserActivity *)userActivity restorationHandler:(void (^)(NSArray *restorableObjects))restorationHandler {
   [[Branch getInstance] continueUserActivity:userActivity];
   // ... your other logic here, such as ...
   [self continueUserActivity:userActivity];

	return YES;
}
{% endhighlight %}

## What happens to existing links? 

### If you use bnc.lt as your domain
Universal Links are of the form `https://bnc.lt/Â«four-letter-identifierÂ»/Â«link-hashÂ»`. Existing links created prior to enabling Universal Links are of the form `https://bnc.lt/m/Â«link-hashÂ»` or `https://bnc.lt/l/Â«link-hashÂ»` and will continue to function as non-Universal Links.

Aliased links on the bnc.lt domain (e.g., `bnc.lt/download`) are not compatible with Universal Links.

### If you use a custom domain or subdomain
Branch links with custom domains are always enabled for Universal Links, even if generated prior to when you enable the feature.

## Apps/browsers that support Universal Links

Unfortunately, Universal Links don't work quite everywhere yet. We'll maintain this list and keep it up to date. *Last updated 1/25/15*.

| **App/Browser** | **Status**
| --- | ---
| Messages | works
| Mail | works
| Whatsapp | works
| Slack | works, if it's set to open Safari, not in-app browser (uses SFSafariViewController)
| Safari | works conditionally *
| Chrome | works conditionally *
| Google | works conditionally *
| Gmail | if Chrome installed, opens link in Chrome (not Universal Link). Else, works conditionally *
| Inbox | if Chrome installed, opens link in Chrome (not Universal Link). Else, works.
| Twitter | works conditionally *
| Facebook | works conditionally *
| FB Messenger | works conditionally *
| WeChat | works conditionally *
| Pinterest | not working
| Telegram | not working (uses SFSafariViewController)

*Note: Conditionally working means that it works (i.e., opens the app) some of the time:*

- Universal Links will not work if you paste the link into the browser URL field.
- Universal Links work with a user driven `<a href="...">` element click *across domains*. Example: if there is a Universal Link on google.com pointing to bnc.lt, it will open the app.
- Universal Links will not work with a user driven `<a href="...">` element click on the *same domain*. Example: if there is a Universal Link on google.com pointing to a different Universal Link on google.com, it will not open the app.
- Universal Links cannot be triggered via Javascript (in `window.onload` or via a `.click()` call on an `<a>` element), unless it is part of a user action.
- Google, Gmail, Inbox, Twitter, Facebook, FB Messenger, WeChat -- Universal Links only work when you have a webview already open. In other words, they do not work in-app from the feed / main views. Again, they also *must* be cross-domain, aka if your user is on yourapp.com and clicks a Universal Link also for yourapp.com, it will not work. However, clicking from yourapp.com to bnc.lt will trigger the link to function as a Universal Link and open your app directly.

## Troubleshooting Universal Links

##### Is it definitely a Universal Link?
Universal Links are in the form https://bnc.lt/<<four-letter-identifier>>/<<link-hash>>. If there is a four letter code between two slashes, then it's a Universal Link. If it isn't a Universal Link, follow the above instructions to enable Universal Links, and double check that your Branch Dashboard Settings > Link Settings for iOS have "Enable Universal Links" checked. Note that aliased links bnc.lt/<custom label> don't work unless you're using a white labeled domain. 

##### Are you testing by manually entering into Safari?
Universal Links don't work properly when entered into Safari. Use Notes or iMessage for testing.

##### Are your applinks entitlements correct?
Confirm the domains you configured in Xcode are correct

##### Is the entitlements file included for your build target?
It seems that Xcode, by default, will not include the `.entitlements` file in your build. You have to check the box in the right sidebar against the correct target to ensure it's included in your app.

##### Do your Team ID & Bundle ID match those on your dashboard?
You can find them in the Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings, in the iOS section next to "Enable Universal Links." They should match your Team ID and Bundle ID. Team ID can be found here [https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/index.action#accountSummary](https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/index.action#accountSummary). Your Bundle ID is found in Xcode, in the `General` tab for the correct build target. If your Apple App Prefix is different from your Team ID, you should use your App Prefix. Your app prefix can be found from App IDs on Apple's Developer Portal.

##### Have you deleted the app and reinstalled it?
iOS does not re-scrape the apple-app-site-association file unless you delete and reinstall the app. (The only exception to this is App Store updates. iOS does rescrape on every update. This means that when users update to a version of your app with the applinks entitlement, Universal Links will start working for them.)

##### Universal Links can be disabled, unfortunately.
If you are successfully taken into your app via a Universal Link, you'll see "bnc.lt" (or your domain) and a forward button in the top right corner of the status bar. If you click that button, Apple will no longer activate Universal Links in the future. To re-enable Universal Links, long press on the link in Messages or Notes and choose 'Open in <<App>>'.

##### Using a custom domain?
Make sure it's configured correctly. You can find configuration issues by using our [Universal Link Validator](http://branch.io/resources/universal-links/).

If you're using a custom subdomain, your CNAME should point to `custom.bnc.lt` under [Link Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link) in the Branch dashboard.

The following error message will appear in your OS-level logs if your domain doesn't have SSL set up properly:

{% highlight js %}
Sep 21 14:27:01 Derricks-iPhone swcd[2044] <Notice>: 2015-09-21 02:27:01.878907 PM [SWC] ### Rejecting URL 'https://examplecustomdomain.com/apple-app-site-association' for auth method 'NSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust': -6754/0xFFFFE59E kAuthenticationErr
{% endhighlight %}

These logs can be found for physical devices connected to Xcode by navigating to Window > Devices > choosing your device and then clicking the "up" arrow in the bottom left corner of the main view.

##### Using Facebook's SDK?
We've recently discovered a bug with Facebook's SDK returning `NO` for `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` preventing Universal Links from working on cold start. Call `accountForFacebookSDKPreventingAppLaunch` on your Branch instance before initializing the session.

##### `bnc.lt` links with your Test Key?
Due to a change in iOS 9.3.1, Universal Links will not work on *Test* apps using the `bnc.lt` domain. We're working on resolving this. Please test Universal Links with your Live app, where they will work as expected. [Read more](http://status.branch.io/incidents/b0c19p6hpq58){:target="_blank"}. 

## What changed in iOS 9 and 9.2?

Apple introduced Universal Links in iOS 9.0, as an alternative to the conventional method of JavaScript/URL-scheme link routing. Apple made it impossible to use JavaScript/URL-scheme routing beginning with iOS 9.2, leaving Universal Links as the only supported method. 

We have published a number of resources that can help you understand the changes and how it impacts your app:
