#### Using our Mobile SDKs
- The **[Creating Links in Apps]({{base.url}}/getting-started/creating-links-in-apps)** page describes how to generate Branch links inside your app.

#### Using the Branch Dashboard
- You can use the Branch Dashboard to **[easily create one-off links]({{base.url}}/getting-started/creating-links-in-apps/#dashboard)**.

#### By dynamically appending link parameters
- You can build Branch links by **[dynamically appending query parameters]({{base.url}}/getting-started/creating-links-in-apps/#appending-query-parameters)**. This method is useful if you don’t want to wait for a server callback, and don’t need to display the resulting (long) link to the user.

#### Using the Web SDK
The Web SDK offers several useful features:

- **[Text-Me-The-App]({{base.url}}/features/text-me-the-app)**
- **[Smart Banner]({{base.url}}/features/smart-banner)**
- **[Website To App Routing]({{base.url}}/features/website-to-app-routing)**
- **[Generic link() function](creating-links-in-other-ways/#link-function)**

#### With the HTTP API
- You can use our **[HTTP API](creating-links-in-other-ways/#http-api)** to build something custom.
