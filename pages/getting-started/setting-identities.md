Identifying your users will help you associate all activities and links created to a particular person. This can show you which of your users are the most influential.

{% ingredient quickstart-prerequisite %}{% endingredient %}

## Log in

{% if page.ios %}

Add a `setIdentity` call wherever you create or login a user. This should be done after you have successfully initialized a Branch session. Only call `setIdentity` when the user first logs in. We will cache the identity for future sessions.

{% tabs %}
{% tab objective-c %}
{% highlight objc %}
// your app's userId, 127 chars or less
[[Branch getInstance] setIdentity:@"your user id"];
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab swift %}
{% highlight swift %}
// your app's userId, 127 chars or less
Branch.getInstance().setIdentity("your user id")
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Log out

Add a `logout` call anywhere you allow the user to logout. `Logout` should only be called when the user logs out. Calling it at other times could lead to hard-to-discover errors. Failing to call `logout` can likewise lead to bugs if multiple users log in on the same device.

{% tabs %}
{% tab objective-c %}
{% highlight objc %}
[[Branch getInstance] logout];
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab swift %}
{% highlight swift %}
Branch.getInstance().logout()
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% highlight c# %}
Branch branch = Branch.GetInstance ();
branch.SetIdentityAsync("your user id", this);
{% endhighlight %}

Add a `LogoutAsync` call anywhere you allow the user to logout. `LogoutAsync` should only be called when the user logs out. Calling it at other times could lead to hard-to-discover errors. Failing to call `LogoutAsync` can likewise lead to bugs if multiple users log in on the same device.

{% highlight c# %}
Branch.GetInstance(getApplicationContext()).LogoutAsync(this);
{% endhighlight %}

{% protip title="Retroactive event attribution" %}
The **first** time `setIdentity` is called for each unique user ID, it will retroactively associate any previously recorded events from the current device with that user ID. This only occurs once.
