Welcome to the Branch Content Sharing Tutorial! Today you will be learning how to share deep linked content with your friends by simply pressing a button inside your app and generating a link with the Branch SDK.

This tutorial assumes that you have created your own project in Xcode or are using the Branch sample project. Before you start, please make sure that you have [signed up](https://dashboard.branch.io/login) for a Branch user account, are logged in, and are in [dashboard.branch.io](https://dashboard.branch.io) in your browser. 

The tutorial is broken up into six parts: integrating the Branch SDK, setting up your app in the Apple Developer Portal, setting up Universal Links, creating deep links, allowing for deep link routing, and testing your app. Letâ€™s get started!
