## Create a Branch Ad Link

1. Create a Branch Ad link from the [Partner Management page](https://dashboard.branch.io/ads/partner-management)'s `Create Google Adwords Link` button under the Google Adwords Partner and select `Create Search Link`
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/create-link-search.png' half center alt='Link Creation' %}
1. Under the Define Section, pick a Link Name for later reference
1. Configure the link with the Ad Format set to **Search** and the Ad Partner set to **Google Adwords**, while leaving the Campaign field blank
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/google-xplatform-search-ads/ad-link-setup.png' 3-quarters center alt='Create Ad Link' %}
1. Under the Configure Options tab, navigate to the Redirects sub section and ensure that the Web redirect is set to the desired final website promoted by the ad campaign.

1. Under the Analytics Tags sub section additional tags can be set. It is recommended to not set Channel and Campaign tags as they will be dynamically generated by Google.
{% image src='/img/pages/features/ads-analytics/analytics-tags.png' 3-quarters center alt='Analytics Tags' %}

{% protip title="Dynamic Channel and Campaign Tags" %}

It is recommended to leave the Channel and Campaign Tags empty as Branch will dynamically set those values to their corresponding **Network** and **Campaign Id** values in Adwords. If you fill in these values yourself it may be more difficult to interpret the information between Branch and Adwords.

{% endprotip %}

{% protip title="Optional: Deep Link Data (Advanced)" %}

You can use this configuration section to specify custom link parameters that will be deep linked into the app after install. These could include a coupon code or a page identifier to route the user. Visit the [Deep Link Routing]({{base.url}}/getting-started/deep-link-routing) page to learn more.

{% endprotip %}

## Configure an Ad

To set up a Search Network Campaign, you will need to first create your campaign and then setup a tracking template on the ad. Additional Adwords information on Search Network campaigns can be found **[here](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6340430?hl=en)**.

#### Create Your Campaign

1. Select `Search Network only` on Adwords
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/adwords-search-network.png' third center alt='Adwords Network' %}
1. Select the desired type of Search Campaign (Branch links support **Standard** and **Dynamic Search** types)
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/google-xplatform-search-ads/adwords-search-network.png' 3-quarters center alt='Adwords Setup' %}
1. Continue setting the campaign and ad group parameters

#### Ad Creation

1. For Dynamic Search Ads, set the website used to be the Final Website the ad should route to, and for Standard Search ads set the **Final URL** field to the Final Website value. This should be the same website that your Branch link routes to.
1. Locate the `Ad URL options (advanced)` section and expand it. Now copy your Branch Ad link from the previous step into the **Tracking Template** field. _Note: for Standard Search ads the advanced URL options are not available in the default campaign creation flow, but can be accessed any time after the Search Network campaign has been set up_

{% image src="/img/pages/features/google-dla/google-xplatform-search-ads/adwords-configuration.png" 3-quarters center alt='Example Adwords Config' %}

{% protip %}

Because the **Final URL** for your app install campaigns must match the final destination website, you cannot put a Branch link in that box. However, capturing installs and deep linking users through content is still possible due to the **Tracking template** configuration.

## FAQ / Debugging

**Q: Why is my advertisement being disapproved on Adwords?**

**A:** Sometimes, your ad may be disapproved if the Branch link does not re-direct to Google Play or App Store when clicked on a desktop. Please ensure that for the Branch link you're using to track installs, Deepviews are disabled and a desktop redirect is set to either the App / Play store.

**Q: I don't see the `Ad URL options (advanced)` option for my Search ad. Where do I find it?**

**A:** For Standard Search Ads the advanced URL options aren't available in the default campaign creation flow, but can be accessed any time after the Search Network campaign has been set up.
