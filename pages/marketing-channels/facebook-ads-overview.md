Branch links can be used together with Facebook ads, allowing you to track ad-driven installs on the Branch dashboard and deep link those new users directly to content the first time they open your app.

Facebook's Ad Platform supports numerous campaign types and a shared set of advertisement formats. To navigate Facebook's Advertisement Platform we created a guide to help you find the right documentation.

This documentation supports the following Facebook Ad Campaigns:

Facebook Campaign Category | Campaign Type/Objective | Branch Documentation Link | Branch Ad Format
