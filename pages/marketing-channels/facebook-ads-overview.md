Branch links can be used together with Facebook ads, allowing you to track ad-driven installs on the Branch dashboard and deep link those new users directly to content the first time they open your app. Refer to [Facebook's Ad Guide](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide){:target="_blank"} to learn more.

Facebook's Ad Platform supports numerous campaign types and a shared set of advertisement formats. To help you navigate Facebook's Advertisement Platform we created this guide detailing how to use Branch links in all major Facebook ad types.

Please find our latest Facebook instructions in our new [documentation portal](https://docs.branch.io/pages/deep-linked-ads/facebook-ads-overview/).
