Branch understand the fatigue that can come from having your data spread out across multiple dashboards. To that end, we provide several options to consolidate your data all in one place.

## Data Integrations Partners {% premiumflag %}{% endpremiumflag %}

Branch has created simple one-click integrations with many of the top analytics providers to get the data you need where it needs to go. These integrations are part of our Premium Features. Information about cost and free trial can be found on our [pricing page](https://branch.io/pricing/).

## Other Mechanisms

If you use a different analytics provider not listed here, or if you have your own in-house analytics, we provide a robust [Webhooks]({{base.url}}/getting-started/webhooks/overview) system which will allow you to forward all your relevant events (clicks, opens, installs, etc.) anywhere you'd like.

Additionally, we provide an [Export API]({{base.url}}/methods-endpoints/data-export-api/guide) so that you can bulk export your events on a daily/weekly basis.
