There are a million and one ways to use Branch in your app! In this section, we get you up to speed on the basics of the Branch platform.

#### If this is your first visit...
- The **[SDK Integration Guide](sdk-integration-guide)** is a good place to begin. This covers what you need to get our mobile SDK integrated into your app, which is the foundation for everything else.

#### Next steps to take
- After integrating the SDK, you will want to enable **[iOS Universal Links](universal-app-links)** if your app has an iOS version. **You must enable Universal Links before Branch can function correctly on iOS 9.2+!**
- The **[Creating Links](creating-links)** page describes all the different ways you can generate Branch links. You may also find the **[Dynamic Link Builder](dynamic-link-builder)** useful.
- You will want to know the various options for **[Configuring Links](configuring-links)** to customize functionality and display.
- **[Deep Link Routing](deep-link-routing)** allows you control what users see first after opening your app from a Branch link. It's a powerful feature you will want to enable.

#### More advanced concepts
- Testing Branch functionality in your app can be a challenge. Read about some tips and tools on the **[Integration Testing](integration-testing)** page.
- Wondering about the tech specs behind Branch links? The **[Matching Accuracy](matching-accuracy)** page describes the methods we use.
- **[Tracking Events](tracking-events)** and **[Setting Identities](setting-identities)** are both powerful features with many useful applications.
