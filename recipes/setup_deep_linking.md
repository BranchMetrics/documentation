Deep linking is an incredibly important part of building your app, and essential for delivering a high quality user experience. When a user clicks a link, you should take them to the exact thing they clicked on. Branch simplifies the process of setting this up by giving you a single routing function that contains all of the keys and values associated with a link that was clicked, so that you can load the appropriate page.

## Create your deep link

## Alternate 1: Easy deep link routing

## Alternate 2: Handle routing yourself in the Branch callback

## Supporting existing routes
