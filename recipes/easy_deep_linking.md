iOS and Android both have championed the development of native apps through the process of _storyboarding_ out your views. A storyboard naturally has an entry point and and ending point. To route to the middle of the story and skip the beginning is a completely foreign concept. To make matters worse, you have to restructure a lot of aspects of your app to support it. Maybe you depend on static variables to be initialized at the start, meaning that the app will crash if routing to a later page. Perhaps you need to handle a back button? Do you need to prefill the back stack? What if the app is running in the background and the back stack is filled with a bunch of other views.

Itâ€™s complicated. This guide will show you to how setup deep link routing in the simplest possible way.
