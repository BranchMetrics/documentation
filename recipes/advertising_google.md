{% protip title="Still need to integrate Branch?" %}This guide assumes that you have 1. already [integrated Branch](/recipes/quickstart_guide/ios/) and 2. configured your app to [send IDFA or GAID](/recipes/submitting_apps/ios/). These are prerequisites to install ads, so please do them first.

## Google Ads & Branch

If you're running Google AdWords campaigns, whether they're of the Search or Display variety, Branch links can be placed inside your campaigns and deeplink a user through the install process. Imagine you're running a promo for 20% of your first purchae for new installs -- you can pass that data through Branch links and give people coming in from Google AdWords that experience!

## Pre-req: Create a Branch Link

## Google AdWords Search Campaigns

We'll walk you through the steps required to set up a Google AdWords campaign using Branch links. Because the *final URL* for your app install campaigns must match your domain, you can no longer put a Branch link in that box. However, capturing installs and deeplinking users through content is very straight forward.

First, grab your iTunes URL or Google Play Store URL, in addition to the Branch link you created from the earlier step.

### Create an Ad

After you've added your headline and description for the ad units, navigate to the *Final URL* and *Ad URL options* section.

In the *Final URL*, you will put your iTunes App Store URL, or Google Play Store URL. 

Expand *Ad URL options*. Here is where you will place the Branch link from the first step. No need to add any extra parameters.

### Finished

That's it! Users clicking your links and downloading to deeplinked content will now display on your Branch dashboard.

## Google Display Network Campaigns

Like Search cammpaigns, Google Display Network campaigns allow you to place Branch links and direct traffic to mobile conversions. We're in testing stages of Google Display. When we are 100% on our finalized integration, we will provide steps here.
