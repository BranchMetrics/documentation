{% if page.overview %}

The Branch Smart Banner displays a fully-customizable banner at the top of your website, encouraging your mobile visitors to download the app (or open it, if already installed). Desktop visitors may enter their phone number to send themselves a link via SMS.

The Download/Open button and SMS link both contain all the features of any other Branch link, including deeplinking directly to content, passing data across install, measuring clicks, and more.
