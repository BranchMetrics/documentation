# Overview

Universal Links were introduced with iOS 9, and became the only fully-functional deeplinking option on iOS after [Apple stopped supporting URL schemes for deeplinking in iOS 9.2](https://blog.branch.io/ios-9.2-redirection-update-uri-scheme-and-universal-links). Universal Links route to your app if it is installed, but Safari will no longer open as part of the redirection process.
