The first section of this page describes the required Dashboard steps for getting your {{page.platform_formatted}} app up and running. After you complete these required steps, you can either keep reading for additional options, or you should check out the [Configuring Client Apps](/domains/configuring_client_apps/{{page.platform}}/) page.

## Configuring the Dashboard for your {{ page.platform_formatted }} app
{% ingredient dashboard_setup/app_name %}{% endingredient %}
{% ingredient dashboard_setup/web_url %}{% endingredient %}
{% ingredient dashboard_setup/store_or_custom_url %}{% endingredient %}
{% ingredient dashboard_setup/uri_scheme %}{% endingredient %}

That's the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, keep reading.

Lastly, if your {{page.platform_formatted}} app isn't fully configured inside the app, simple instructions for installing our SDK can be found on the [Configuring Client Apps](/domains/configuring_client_apps/{{page.platform}}/) page.
