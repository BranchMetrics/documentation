Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. With Branch links, you can tell whether a user installed your app thanks to a Facebook ad, an email campaign or a personal invite from a friend.On the world wide web, URLs allow users to go straight to content rather than wading through an entire site. You can send your friend a link to a specific radio station – http://www.iheart.com/live/wild-949-305/ – and other users will be taken straight to that station. Branch links work the same way. The link https://bnc.lt/l/3mN6Lak-2u will open the Wild 94.9 station even if you didn’t have the app installed previously.Here’s how to create your own Branch Links.On iOS, it’s a rather simple method call.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift"},{"title":"Attaching Custom Data to Links","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/add_custom_link_data_and_routing/#attaching-custom-data-to-links","body":"Branch links allow you to attach any information you want to links. Custom data can be information about an ad campaign, referring user, promotion, or content being shared. You use it to build a personalized referral system so users never see a generic onboarding screen again. You can take users straight to the content they wanted to see when they clicked the link in the first place.Imagine how URLs are used on the Internet… now you have the same power inside your native mobile apps.This data is stored on our backend and presented again when the user clicks on a link via the deepLinkHandler – it’s not simply appended to the end of the URL.   Tip: Aliasing Links\nBecause we don’t store data in the URL, you can create pretty links, like bnc.lt/bob. For information on custom aliases for links, see the section below, Alias – The Custom Ending.\nStore data about both the sharing user and the content shared in the data dictionary. Attaching information is as simple as including a dictionary at link creation time. If, for example, James is inviting friends to check out your app, you could do the following:\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{  @\"referringUsername\": @\"James\",\n                                                @\"referringUserId\": @\"1234\",\n                                                @\"contentId\": @\"0987\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);    \n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   Tip: Identify your users!\nYou should identify your users so that you know who is sharing–and who is effectively driving the most installs and engagement.\nCustomizing and Tagging LinksSpecifying ChannelIf you want a breakdown of your best performing channels–whether you measure best performing by most installs, most actual signups, or any other custom events you want to track–you should specify the channel. This can be done both for marketing links on the dashboard and for links created programmatically.On iOS, it’s a rather simple method call.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{ @\"foo\": @\"bar\" }\n                                 andChannel:@\"SMS\"\n                                 andFeature:nil\n                                andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswiftYou can safely pass in nil for any options you don’t wish to specify.Adding TagsAre you a tag person? You can add as many simply tags as you want to a link. Note that these are not key-value pairs – those belong in the custom data dictionary.No mysteries here:\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{}\n                                    andTags:@[@\"any\", @\"other\", @\"tags\", @\"you\", @\"want\"]\n                                 andChannel:nil\n                                 andFeature:nil\n                                   andStage:nil\n                                   andAlias:nil\n                                andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswiftSpecifying FeatureThe more analytics the better. If you want to track whether personalized invites, content shares or gift offers are driving more installs, you can optionally specify a feature tag.By default we provide some suggestions for filling in feature when creating a link. Those are:\n  share\n  referral\n  invite\n  deal\n  gift\nYou should feel free to specify any other “features” as you see fit.Again, the code is straightforward:\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{}\n                                 andChannel:@\"SMS\"\n                                 andFeature:@\"invite\"\n                                andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswiftOG Tags - Looking Good on Social MediaIf you want to tailor how a link will appear on social media, you should make use of our support for Open Graph (OG) tags. You can customize the OG tags associated with the link by including key-value pairs in the params dictionary when creating a link. Note that these overwrite any defaults that you previously set on the Branch Dashboard.\n  \n    \n      Key\n      Value\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      “$og_title”\n      The title you’d like to appear for the link in social media\n    \n    \n      “$og_description”\n      The description you’d like to appear for the link in social media\n    \n    \n      “$og_image_url”\n      The URL for the image you’d like to appear for the link in social media\n    \n    \n      “$og_video”\n      The URL for the video\n    \n    \n      “$og_url”\n      The URL you’d like to appear\n    \n    \n      “$og_app_id”\n      Your OG app ID. Optional and rarely used.\n    \n  \n\n\n// Facebook OG tags -- this will overwrite any defaults you set up on the Branch Dashboard\nNSMutableDictionary *params = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];\nparams[@\"$og_title\"] = @\"MyApp is disrupting apps\";\nparams[@\"og_description\"] = @\"Out of all the apps disrupting apps, MyApp is without a doubt a leader.

We have left the other parameters blank intentionally. You may customize them as you see fit.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:nil\n                                 andChannel:nil\n                                 andFeature:nil\n                                   andStage:nil\n                                   andAlias:@\"custom_ending\"\n                                andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswiftCustom RedirectsiOS App Store override - $ios_urlWhen a user doesn’t have your app and clicks a link on iOS, by default the user is taken to the App Store or Custom URL that you specified on the Dashboard. If you want to specify a different destination on a per-link basis, include a value for the $ios_url.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"$ios_url\": @\"http://myawesomesite.com/ios-app-landing-page\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url)\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift\n  Android Play Store override - $android_urlWhen a user doesn’t have your app and clicks a link on Android, by default the user is taken to the Play Store or Custom URL that you specified on the Dashboard. If you want to specify a different destination on a per-link basis, include a value for the $android_url.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"$android_url\": @\"http://myawesomesite.com/android-app-landing-page\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift\nDesktop override - $desktop_urlWhen a user clicks a Branch link from a desktop, by default the user is taken to a text-me-the-app page or whichever custom page you specify on the Dashboard’s Link Settings page. If you want to specify a different web page on a per-link basis, include a value for $desktop_url.This is especially useful if you want to serve up content on the web for users who don’t have your mobile app.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"$desktop_url\": @\"http://myawesomesite.com/content/the-desired-content\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift\nAlways try to open the app - $always_deeplinkIn certain cases you may want to override the default Branch behavior, which uses cookies and communication with our backend to determine whether to open an app. Branch knows that a user has the app if that user has clicked a Branch link and opened the app. This means that the first time a user clicks a Branch link, even if the app is installed, we will direct the user to the App Store.To override this behavior, you can either select “Always try to open the app” on the Dashboard, or you can specify “$always_deeplink” : “true” on a per-link basis.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"$always_deeplink\": @\"true\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift\nSpecify a custom deeplink path - $deeplink_pathThe value of the deeplink path that you’d like us to append to your URI. For example, you could specify “$deeplink_path”: “radio/station/456” and we’ll open the app with the URI “yourapp://radio/station/456?link_click_id=branch-identifier”. This is primarily for supporting legacy deeplinking infrastructure.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"$deeplink_path\": @\"radio/station/456\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswiftRoutingYour app can deliver users a custom experience based on the Branch link they clicked on that directed them to the app.This means that you can:\n  customize the signup/login flow\n  take the user straight to a specific screen in your app\n  congratulate the user on getting credits for signing up via a friend’s link\n  … and so on.\nBranch is able to pass data through install. When the user first opens the app, Branch makes a fast asynchronous call to the server to see whether the user has clicked on a link, and if so, what data is associated with it. This means that you should design routing accordingly.Example CodeRouting to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside of the deepLinkHandler, you will want to examine the params dictionary to determine whether the user clicked on a link to content. Regardless of whether your app involves pictures, videos, text or whatever novel content your app contains, you likely have an internal system of identifiers.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures and each one is tagged with a picture Id. When a user shares a picture, simply attach a picture Id to the Branch link being created. If a user clicks a link to a specific picture, this Id will show up in the params dictionary in the deepLinkHandler.- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\n  // initialize the session, setup a deep link handler\n  [[Branch getInstance] initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions\n                          andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n\n    // start setting up the view controller hierarchy\n    UINavigationController *navC = (UINavigationController *)self.window.rootViewController;\n    UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"Main\" bundle:nil];\n    UIViewController *nextVC;\n    // If the key 'pictureId' is present in the deep link dictionary\n    // then load the picture screen with the appropriate picture\n    NSString *pictureId = [params objectForKey:@\"pictureId\"];\n    if (pictureId) {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"PicVC\"];\n      [nextVC setNextPictureId:pictureId];\n    } else {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"MainVC\"];\n    }\n    [navC setViewControllers:@[nextVC] animated:YES];\n  }];\n\n  return YES;\n}For a concrete example of giving users a customized experience via Branch links, check out our Branchster Example.Additional OptionsAdding StageStage is one of our lesser used options but is useful nonetheless. Useful for tracking at what stage in your app a link was created. Stage is fully determined by you and is specific to each app. Sample stages include:\n  pre_signup\n  mid_signup\n  post_signup\n  viewing_content\n  on_home_screen\nIf your app is a game, stage could require to the user’s current level.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:nil andTags:nil andChannel:nil andFeature:nil andStage:@\"4\" andAlias:nil andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswiftMatch DurationWhen we see a link click, we generate a fingerprint for users and store that fingerprint for a limited time – 2 hours by default. That browser fingerprint includes IP address, OS, OS version, etc. Then when that same user who clicked the link opens up an app with the Branch SDK, Branch creates a device fingerprint based on the same parameters and checks with the server to see if a matching browser fingerprint exists.It’s possible, albeit rare, for collisions to occur where two people on the same network have identical hardware, are running identical software, and click a link at the same time (and neithe of them have ever used an app with Branch before). One way to avoid these collisions is to shorten the time window that a browser fingerprint is stored on our servers waiting for a matching device fingerprint.You can adjust how long the browser fingerprint is stored in the browser by setting a duration when you click the link.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{}\n                                 andChannel:@\"SMS\"\n                                 andFeature:nil\n                                   andStage:nil\n                           andMatchDuration:(60*60*2)\n                                andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift"},{"title":"   Tip: Aliasing Links","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/add_custom_link_data_and_routing/","body":"Because we don’t store data in the URL, you can create pretty links, like bnc.lt/bob.

Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. With Branch links, you can tell whether a user installed your app thanks to a Facebook ad, an email campaign or a personal invite from a friend.On the world wide web, URLs allow users to go straight to content rather than wading through an entire site. You can send your friend a link to a specific radio station – http://www.iheart.com/live/wild-949-305/ – and other users will be taken straight to that station. Branch links work the same way. The link https://bnc.lt/l/3mN6Lak-2u will open the Wild 94.9 station even if you didn’t have the app installed previously.Here’s how to create your own Branch Links.JSONObject obj = new JSONObject(); obj.putString(\"foo\", \"bar\");\nbranch.getShortUrl(obj, new BranchLinkCreateListener() {\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onLinkCreate(String url, BranchError error) {\n\t\tLog.i(TAG, \"Ready to share my link = \" + url);\n\t}\n});"},{"title":"Attaching Custom Data to Links","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/add_custom_link_data_and_routing/android/#attaching-custom-data-to-links","body":"Branch links allow you to attach any information you want to links. Custom data can be information about an ad campaign, referring user, promotion, or content being shared. You use it to build a personalized referral system so users never see a generic onboarding screen again. You can take users straight to the content they wanted to see when they clicked the link in the first place.Imagine how URLs are used on the Internet… now you have the same power inside your native mobile apps.This data is stored on our backend and presented again when the user clicks on a link via the deepLinkHandler – it’s not simply appended to the end of the URL.   Tip: Aliasing Links\nBecause we don’t store data in the URL, you can create pretty links, like bnc.lt/bob. For information on custom aliases for links, see the section below, Alias – The Custom Ending.\nStore data about both the sharing user and the content shared in the data dictionary. Attaching information is as simple as including a dictionary at link creation time. If, for example, James is inviting friends to check out your app, you could do the following:Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext()).getShortUrl(obj, new BranchLinkCreateListener() {\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onLinkCreate(String url, BranchError error) {\n\t    Log.i(\"Branch\", \"Got a link with custom data!\");\n\t}\n});   Tip: Identify your users!\nYou should identify your users so that you know who is sharing–and who is effectively driving the most installs and engagement.\nCustomizing and Tagging LinksSpecifying ChannelIf you want a breakdown of your best performing channels–whether you measure best performing by most installs, most actual signups, or any other custom events you want to track–you should specify the channel. This can be done both for marketing links on the dashboard and for links created programmatically.In Android, you will need to use a method call that accepts a String channel type parameter, for all URL generation calls.Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext()).getContentUrl(\"sms\",  null, new BranchLinkCreateListener() {\n    @Override\n    public void onLinkCreate(String url, BranchError error) {\n    }\n});Adding TagsAre you a tag person?

That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside onStart, when Branch is initialized, you will want to examine the dictionary we pass to you from our callback. This will allow you to know whether or not a link click with context was made. You’ll likely have many entry points based off different parameters.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures, and each picture has an ID. When user A decides to share a picture, attach that ID to the shortUrl or LongURL being created. When User B downloads (or opens the app if they already have it), the call to initSession will inform you of the parameters user A sent.

Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. With Branch links, you can tell whether a user installed your app thanks to a Facebook ad, an email campaign or a personal invite from a friend.On the world wide web, URLs allow users to go straight to content rather than wading through an entire site. You can send your friend a link to a specific radio station – http://www.iheart.com/live/wild-949-305/ – and other users will be taken straight to that station. Branch links work the same way. The link https://bnc.lt/l/3mN6Lak-2u will open the Wild 94.9 station even if you didn’t have the app installed previously.Here’s how to create your own Branch Links.On iOS, it’s a rather simple method call.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift"},{"title":"Attaching Custom Data to Links","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/add_custom_link_data_and_routing/ios/#attaching-custom-data-to-links","body":"Branch links allow you to attach any information you want to links.

You use it to build a personalized referral system so users never see a generic onboarding screen again. You can take users straight to the content they wanted to see when they clicked the link in the first place.Imagine how URLs are used on the Internet… now you have the same power inside your native mobile apps.This data is stored on our backend and presented again when the user clicks on a link via the deepLinkHandler – it’s not simply appended to the end of the URL.   Tip: Aliasing Links\nBecause we don’t store data in the URL, you can create pretty links, like bnc.lt/bob. For information on custom aliases for links, see the section below, Alias – The Custom Ending.\nStore data about both the sharing user and the content shared in the data dictionary. Attaching information is as simple as including a dictionary at link creation time. If, for example, James is inviting friends to check out your app, you could do the following:\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{  @\"referringUsername\": @\"James\",\n                                                @\"referringUserId\": @\"1234\",\n                                                @\"contentId\": @\"0987\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);    \n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   Tip: Identify your users!\nYou should identify your users so that you know who is sharing–and who is effectively driving the most installs and engagement.\nCustomizing and Tagging LinksSpecifying ChannelIf you want a breakdown of your best performing channels–whether you measure best performing by most installs, most actual signups, or any other custom events you want to track–you should specify the channel.

That browser fingerprint includes IP address, OS, OS version, etc. Then when that same user who clicked the link opens up an app with the Branch SDK, Branch creates a device fingerprint based on the same parameters and checks with the server to see if a matching browser fingerprint exists.It’s possible, albeit rare, for collisions to occur where two people on the same network have identical hardware, are running identical software, and click a link at the same time (and neithe of them have ever used an app with Branch before). One way to avoid these collisions is to shorten the time window that a browser fingerprint is stored on our servers waiting for a matching device fingerprint.You can adjust how long the browser fingerprint is stored in the browser by setting a duration when you click the link.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{}\n                                 andChannel:@\"SMS\"\n                                 andFeature:nil\n                                   andStage:nil\n                           andMatchDuration:(60*60*2)\n                                andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift"},{"title":"   Tip: Aliasing Links","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/add_custom_link_data_and_routing/ios/","body":"Because we don’t store data in the URL, you can create pretty links, like bnc.lt/bob.

(In the example in part 3 below, if Bob’s friend Amy had already found and opened the app on her own but later came back to it because Bob sent her a link, Bob is the referring user and Amy is the referred user.)

You show him the blue sneakers as soon as he opens the app.\n  You run a massive ad campaign that drives a ton of new users to the app. You want create a funnel to see how many users signed up and/or completed purchases after clicking different ads (and the conversion rate).\n  You know that users clicking on your ads are already familiar with your product. So in your app you reduce the carousel shown to new users from 5 to 2 if they’ve come in through an ad.\n   Branch links work even on first install!\nWith standard deeplinks, if a user doesn’t have the app, the link fails.

This gives you flexibility as a marketer. You may decide for certain links that if they do not have the app, the user should be sent to www.yourwebsite.com/a_particular_campaign.In order to configure the links for this ad network integration, you’ll need to point the Branch links to the measurement partner. To do this, you’ll want to customize the endpoints for both Android and iOS. Let’s take the example where you were previously using Adjust with the following template:\n  iOS: https://app.adjust.io/8x54yn?campaign=iOS_search_campaign&adgroup={keyword}&creative={matchtype}&google_network={network}\n  Android: https://app.adjust.io/3D24xy?campaign=Android_search_campaign&adgroup={keyword}&creative={matchtype}&google_network={network}\nYou’d set the custom URL for Android to https://app.adjust.io/3D24xy and the custom URL for iOS to https://app.adjust.io/8x54yn. This would tell Branch where to send the user for the specific OS. Don’t worry about the additional query parameters (the stuff after ‘?’).

In order to properly link the ad network to the measurement partner, you must configure the Branch link to pass through any additional query parameters through to the measurement partner.To do this, please add in the key ‘$query_param_passthrough’ with the value of ‘true’. You can see an example below:\n        \n      Additionally, if you want specify any additional deep link data. You would append it in this list of keys and values.

This is great for segmenting your users and providing higher granularity for your organic cohorts vs paid cohorts.   Still need to integrate Branch?This guide assumes that you have already integrated Branch. If you need to integrate Branch still, jump to “Integrating the SDK”.\nHow It WorksThrough webhooks, we can send all install data that Branch is responsible for. Building on top of Webhooks, we have built a custom integration to automatically send said data without any extra work on your side (besides integrating both SDKs). We just need some configuration information from your Localytics account, and we’ll take care of the rest.   How do we differntiate a Localytics install vs Branch?We rely on a Branch link being clicked which leads to an install. This sets an internal boolean that an install came from Branch, which then fires our webhook.\nBefore you can start sending data, we’ll walk you through a minimum of what is needed.Set Up LocalyticsThis guide assumes you have an account with Localytics already. First, navigate to your account on Localytics, register your application, and grab the sdk.After integrating the SDK, we’ll need your Attribution ID to allow us to attribute. Navigate to the Attribution section, click the ... (overflow) button, and select Settings:Once there, you’ll need to add your Store ID (iTunes for iOS, Play Store for Android).

In order to integrate Mixpanel, follow these instructions.\nGetting StartedIn case you leverage Mixpanel to track in-app events, or want to segment users from Branch installs and calculate LTV, or any other unique use case, we can support you through a couple of methodologies.We have two methods to synchronize data between services. The first is using Branch callbacks to make a call to Mixpanel. This is under methodology 1, Track Through SDK. The second is using Templated Webhooks to deliver data to your backend, which can then send that data to Mixpanel. This is under methodology 2, Track Through Webhooks.Methodology 1 is a simpler integration, but provides less flexibility. Methodology 2 is an advanced integration, but provides a bit more flexibility.Track Through SDKPre-Reqs:\nSuccessful integration of both the Mixpanel and Branch SDKs\nMethods mapped out inside apps that want to event data sent to Mixpanel\nThe easiest way to send event data that comes in from Branch is to invoke the Mixpanel event tracking function inside any Branch callback.In this example, we’ll take an instance of an install responsible by Branch. We let you know if an install (or referred session if a user already had the app) was caused by Branch, by examining the referred parameter.[branch initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) {\n    \tif ([params[@\"referred\"]]) {\n        \t// Add call here to let MP know a Branch-driven install occurred\n        \t[Mixpanel track:@\"install\" properties:params];\n        }\n    }\n}];\nMixpanel would then receive the Branch install event, and you would know Branch is responsible because referred would equal true inside the properties argument.Identity And Customer Segments / ProfilesLet’s say you want to take it a step further and track Branch specific installs and users inside your segments for Mixpanel.

However, if you’ve already completed Step 1 of our quickstart guide, Integrating the SDK, then you can skip Step 1! Jump to Step 2, The Smart Banner. (You can also skip optional Step 3, Configuring the Client, if you’ve performed this step from the quickstart guide.)\nThe mobile web smart banner is a powerful tool–it brings users in from the web experience where they are more easily lost, to your native mobile experience. On desktop, the banner can even drive users to mobile via our text-me-the-app function.It’s highly customizable. If you want simple, cross-platform download links that just work, follow the first two sections on configuring the dashboard and The Smart Banner.If you also want to pass data through the install process or deep link straight to content, check out the optional 3rd and 4th sections on Configuring the Client for Deep Linking and Routing: passing information from the Banner.Configuring the Dashboard for your iOS appApp NameTo get started, point your browser to https://dashboard.branch.io/. If you haven’t created an account before, you should sign up and complete the basic setup. If you’ve signed up already, navigate to the Summary page and click the dropdown button in the top right. Choose “Create new app.” You will be prompted to enter a name for your new app. Do so and press “Create.”Web URL\n        \n      This is where we will take users who click a Branch link if we don’t know where else to take them. For example, if you don’t have an Android app released yet, Android users will be taken to this link. Don’t forget to Save!To configure the Web URL on an existing app, you will need to navigate to the Settings > Link Settings page on the Dashboard. Scroll down to Default URL and enter your website.   Tip:\nYou can customize this fallback URL on a per-platform or even per-link basis. After completing setup, you may want to check out our section on Custom Redirects.\nApp Store or custom URL\n        \n      Part of the magic of Branch Links is that you can have different configurations for iOS, Android, Fire… – and it just works! In this section, you need to specify where the user can download your app.When setting up an iOS app, you need to locate your app in the App Store. Start typing the name of your app and it should show up in the box.You may be wondering–what if I can’t find my app, or it isn’t on the App Store yet? Good news: you can specify any location you want. For iOS apps, you can put in the URL provided by Apple on iTunesConnect (if you anticipate going live soon) or you can specify a custom URL to wherever the app is hosted remotely.   Note:\nThis field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works).  Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the App Store, it will go to this URL. Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Xcode.\nURI Scheme\n        \n      Note: this is required if you want your smart banner to open the app. If, however, you simply want a banner that links to the App Store (on mobile) or that allows users to text themselves the app (on desktop), you can skip this step.Setting the URI scheme is not strictly required if you are only going to use Branch to measure the number of clicks for a given link. To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For iOS apps, the URI scheme can be specified in the .plist file under URL Types. If you haven’t added one to your iOS app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard.The Smart Banner\n        \n      Branch offers a highly customizable smart banner that works across platforms. Android and iOS users can install or open the app from one banner. Users can even be deep linked to content! Desktop users can choose to text themselves the app.   This just works!\nThis short snippet of code below is enough to add a web banner to both your desktop and mobile web pages! Of course, you’ll want to configure it, so check out both the Smart Banner Options and Link Options below.\nAfter configuring your app on the Dashboard, you can simply add the following code somewhere inside the <head> </head> tags on your website. Note that the only thing you need to do is replace YOUR-BRANCH-KEY with your Branch Key inside the init() call.<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    (function(b,r,a,n,c,h,_,s,d,k){if(!b[n]||!b[n]._q){for(;s<_.length;)c(h,_[s++]);d=r.createElement(a);d.async=1;d.src=\"https://cdn.branch.io/branch-v1.5.6.min.js\";k=r.getElementsByTagName(a)[0];k.parentNode.insertBefore(d,k);b[n]=h}})(window,document,\"script\",\"branch\",function(b,r){b[r]=function(){b._q.push([r,arguments])}},{_q:[],_v:1},\"init data setIdentity logout track link sendSMS referrals credits creditHistory applyCode validateCode getCode redeem banner closeBanner\".split(\" \"),0);\n\nbranch.init('YOUR-BRANCH-KEY');\nbranch.banner({\n    icon: 'http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/wineass/ios7-redesign/512/Appstore-icon.png',\n    title: 'Branch Demo App',\n    description: 'The Branch demo app!'\n}, {});\n\n</script>You can find your Branch Key on the Dashboard’s Settings page.Closing the App Banner ProgrammaticallyThe App Banner includes a close button the user can click, but you may want to close the banner with a timeout, or via some other user interaction with your web app. In this case, closing the banner is very simple by calling Branch.closeBanner().js\nbranch.closeBanner();\nSmart Banner Options, Link OptionsThere are a lot of options here, but don’t be scared. Specifying them is optional, although you’ll probably want to do so to tailor it to your needs.branch.banner({\n    icon: 'http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/wineass/ios7-redesign/512/Appstore-icon.png',\n    title: 'Branch Demo App',\n    description: 'The Branch demo app!',\n    openAppButtonText: 'Open',              // Text to show on button if the user has the app installed\n    downloadAppButtonText: 'Download',      // Text to show on button if the user does not have the app installed\n    sendLinkText: 'Send Link',              // Text to show on desktop button to allow users to text themselves the app\n    phonePreviewText: '+44 9999-9999',      // The default phone placeholder is a US format number, localize the placeholder number with a custom placeholder with this option\n    showiOS: true,                          // Should the banner be shown on iOS devices?\n    showAndroid: true,                      // Should the banner be shown on Android devices?\n    showDesktop: true,                      // Should the banner be shown on desktop devices?\n    iframe: true,                           // Show banner in an iframe, recomended to isolate Branch banner CSS\n    disableHide: false,                     // Should the user have the ability to hide the banner?

This is discussed in the sections on Handle Deep Link and Routing below.\n(Optional) Configuring the Client for Deep LinkingInstalling the SDKFor iOS, the easiest way to install the SDK is via Cocoapods. Add pod \"Branch\" to your podfile and run pod install from the command line.However, if you don’t currently use Cocoapods, you can easily download and install our SDK. To download an open-source copy, grab the zip here.You will need to drag and drop the Branch.framework file that you downloaded into your project. Be sure that “Copy items if needed” is selected.\n        \n      You also need to import CoreTelephony. See the graphic here.   Most accurate matching\nTo get the best experience with Branch, you should import AdSupport.framework. This allows us to leverage the IDFA for more accurate matching, and we can also identify users who return later after uninstalling the app.\nBranch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to YourProject-Info.plist (Info.plist for Swift).\n  In plist file, mouse hover “Information Property List” which is the root item under the Key column.\n  After about half a second, you will see a “+” sign appear. Click it.\n  In the newly added row, fill in “branch_key” for its key, leave type as String, and enter your app key obtained in above steps in its value column.\n  Save the plist file.\nAnimated Gif\n        \n      URI SchemeTo set up your URI Scheme, you’ll need to open your project in XCode and complete the following.\n  Click on YourProject-Info.plist on the left (or in Swift, Info.plist).\n  Find URL Types and click the right arrow. (If it doesn’t exist, right click anywhere and choose Add Row. Scroll down and choose URL Types)\n  Add myapp, where myapp is a unique string for your app, as an item in URL Schemes as below:\nGo do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.The deepLinkHandler is a block of code that executes when a Branch session is successfully initialized, as well as anytime a user clicks a link to your app. This is the central place where you define how your app should respond to links.When a user clicks a Branch link and your app opens, the Branch SDK contacts the Branch servers to see whether this user opening your app is the same one who just clicked the link. If it is, then the params dictionary that you see below will be populated with any data attached to a Branch link if a user just clicked one.The initSession call is an asynchronous call and any other calls will be queued up to complete after the server returns a response.For Swift, you will need to add a bridging header in order to use Branch in your project’s files. For help on adding a bridging header, see this StackOverflow answer.There are a few pieces that must be in place. First, open your project’s AppDelegate.m (or AppDelegate.swift) file.\n  Add #import \"Branch.h\" at the top of the file (Objective-C only)\n  Find the line which reads:\n\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\nobjective-cswiftand paste the following right below it:\n\nBranch *branch = [Branch getInstance];\n[branch initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) {\n        // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n        // params will be empty if no data found\n        // ... insert custom logic here ...\n        NSLog(@\"params: %@\", params.description)\n    }\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   initSession is called 100% of the time\ninitSession is always called, whether or not the user clicked on a Branch link. If no Branch link was clicked, params will come back empty. Plan your application logic accordingly!\nNOTE If you are seeing a “Branch.h file not found” error but you’ve imported the SDK, or it’s breaking during compiling–and you’re using Xcode 6.3 or newer–click here.Branch-provided data parameters in callbackPreviously, Branch did not return any information to the app if initSession was called but the user hadn’t clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.\n  ~ denotes analytics\n  + denotes information added by Branch\n  (for the curious, $ denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)\n\n  \n    \n      Parameter\n      Meaning\n    \n    \n      ~channel\n      The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~feature\n      The feature, such as invite or share, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~tags\n      Any tags, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~campaign\n      The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~stage\n      The stage, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~creation_source\n      Where the link was created (‘API’, ‘Dashboard’, ‘SDK’, ‘iOS SDK’, ‘Android SDK’, or ‘Web SDK’)\n    \n    \n      +referrer\n      The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked\n    \n    \n      +phone_number\n      The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app\n    \n    \n      +is_first_session\n      Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)\n    \n    \n      +clicked_branch_link\n      Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session\n    \n  \nHandle Deep LinkIn order for your app to properly handle deep links, and to allow Branch to work its magic and call the deepLinkHandler, you will need to add the following code within application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation::\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {\n    // pass the url to the handle deep link call\n    if (![[Branch getInstance] handleDeepLink:url]) {\n        // do other deep link routing for the Facebook SDK, Pinterest SDK, etc\n    }\n    return YES;\n}\n\nobjective-cswiftRouting to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside of the deepLinkHandler, you will want to examine the params dictionary to determine whether the user clicked on a link to content. Regardless of whether your app involves pictures, videos, text or whatever novel content your app contains, you likely have an internal system of identifiers.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures and each one is tagged with a picture Id. When a user shares a picture, simply attach a picture Id to the Branch link being created. If a user clicks a link to a specific picture, this Id will show up in the params dictionary in the deepLinkHandler.- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\n  // initialize the session, setup a deep link handler\n  [[Branch getInstance] initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions\n                          andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n\n    // start setting up the view controller hierarchy\n    UINavigationController *navC = (UINavigationController *)self.window.rootViewController;\n    UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"Main\" bundle:nil];\n    UIViewController *nextVC;\n    // If the key 'pictureId' is present in the deep link dictionary\n    // then load the picture screen with the appropriate picture\n    NSString *pictureId = [params objectForKey:@\"pictureId\"];\n    if (pictureId) {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"PicVC\"];\n      [nextVC setNextPictureId:pictureId];\n    } else {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"MainVC\"];\n    }\n    [navC setViewControllers:@[nextVC] animated:YES];\n  }];\n\n  return YES;\n}(Optional) Routing: passing information from the BannerNow that you’ve added routing to your app, you can add information to the Smart Banner. If you’ve used the example Smart Banner code above, you simply need to insert any key-value pairs you’d like into the data dictionary.Using our example of routing above with the PicVC, you’d simply need to change the Web Banner code to the following:branch.banner(options, {\n    phone: '9999999999',\n    type: 1,\n    data: {\n        'pictureId': '12345',\n    }\n});Now when a user clicks on the Smart Banner on a mobile device, when they open your app they will be taken straight to a view controller to see picture with id “12345”. It’s that simple.Deep linking has countless possibilities and we’d be happy to brainstorm use cases for your specific app. Happy building!ConclusionYou’ve learned how to add a smart banner to your website with minimal configuration and some copying-and-pasting Javascript into your website. Perhaps the allure of passing data through install or deep linking to content caught your eye and you added the SDK to your iOS app. There’s a ton more that Branch can do. For example, you can:\n  \n    Referrals with incentives – reward users based on the installs or engagement they generate\n  \n  \n    Personalized welcome – tailor onboarding for your users\n  \n  \n    See a list of your top influencers whose shared links are driving the most installs\n  \n  \n    Specify the channel (Facebook, Email, etc.) or tag content as it is being shared – then you can see a breakdown of installs by tag on the Dashboard\n  \nQuestions, comments and love letters are always welcome at support@branchmetrics.io."},{"title":"   Have you already integrated?","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/app_download_banner/","body":"This guide assumes that you haven’t already integrated Branch and provides full step-by-step instructions.

Don’t forget to Save!To configure the Web URL on an existing app, you will need to navigate to the Settings > Link Settings page on the Dashboard. Scroll down to Default URL and enter your website.   Tip:\nYou can customize this fallback URL on a per-platform or even per-link basis. After completing setup, you may want to check out our section on Custom Redirects.\nApp Store or custom URL\n        \n      Part of the magic of Branch Links is that you can have different configurations for iOS, Android, Fire… – and it just works! In this section, you need to specify where the user can download your app.When setting up an iOS app, you need to locate your app in the App Store. Start typing the name of your app and it should show up in the box.You may be wondering–what if I can’t find my app, or it isn’t on the App Store yet? Good news: you can specify any location you want. For iOS apps, you can put in the URL provided by Apple on iTunesConnect (if you anticipate going live soon) or you can specify a custom URL to wherever the app is hosted remotely.   Note:\nThis field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works).  Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the App Store, it will go to this URL. Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Xcode.\nURI Scheme\n        \n      Note: this is required if you want your smart banner to open the app. If, however, you simply want a banner that links to the App Store (on mobile) or that allows users to text themselves the app (on desktop), you can skip this step.Setting the URI scheme is not strictly required if you are only going to use Branch to measure the number of clicks for a given link. To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For iOS apps, the URI scheme can be specified in the .plist file under URL Types. If you haven’t added one to your iOS app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard.The Smart Banner\n        \n      Branch offers a highly customizable smart banner that works across platforms. Android and iOS users can install or open the app from one banner. Users can even be deep linked to content! Desktop users can choose to text themselves the app.   This just works!\nThis short snippet of code below is enough to add a web banner to both your desktop and mobile web pages! Of course, you’ll want to configure it, so check out both the Smart Banner Options and Link Options below.\nAfter configuring your app on the Dashboard, you can simply add the following code somewhere inside the <head> </head> tags on your website. Note that the only thing you need to do is replace YOUR-BRANCH-KEY with your Branch Key inside the init() call.<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    (function(b,r,a,n,c,h,_,s,d,k){if(!b[n]||!b[n]._q){for(;s<_.length;)c(h,_[s++]);d=r.createElement(a);d.async=1;d.src=\"https://cdn.branch.io/branch-v1.5.6.min.js\";k=r.getElementsByTagName(a)[0];k.parentNode.insertBefore(d,k);b[n]=h}})(window,document,\"script\",\"branch\",function(b,r){b[r]=function(){b._q.push([r,arguments])}},{_q:[],_v:1},\"init data setIdentity logout track link sendSMS referrals credits creditHistory applyCode validateCode getCode redeem banner closeBanner\".split(\" \"),0);\n\nbranch.init('YOUR-BRANCH-KEY');\nbranch.banner({\n    icon: 'http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/wineass/ios7-redesign/512/Appstore-icon.png',\n    title: 'Branch Demo App',\n    description: 'The Branch demo app!'\n}, {});\n\n</script>You can find your Branch Key on the Dashboard’s Settings page.Closing the App Banner ProgrammaticallyThe App Banner includes a close button the user can click, but you may want to close the banner with a timeout, or via some other user interaction with your web app. In this case, closing the banner is very simple by calling Branch.closeBanner().js\nbranch.closeBanner();\nSmart Banner Options, Link OptionsThere are a lot of options here, but don’t be scared. Specifying them is optional, although you’ll probably want to do so to tailor it to your needs.branch.banner({\n    icon: 'http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/wineass/ios7-redesign/512/Appstore-icon.png',\n    title: 'Branch Demo App',\n    description: 'The Branch demo app!',\n    openAppButtonText: 'Open',              // Text to show on button if the user has the app installed\n    downloadAppButtonText: 'Download',      // Text to show on button if the user does not have the app installed\n    sendLinkText: 'Send Link',              // Text to show on desktop button to allow users to text themselves the app\n    phonePreviewText: '+44 9999-9999',      // The default phone placeholder is a US format number, localize the placeholder number with a custom placeholder with this option\n    showiOS: true,                          // Should the banner be shown on iOS devices?\n    showAndroid: true,                      // Should the banner be shown on Android devices?\n    showDesktop: true,                      // Should the banner be shown on desktop devices?\n    iframe: true,                           // Show banner in an iframe, recomended to isolate Branch banner CSS\n    disableHide: false,                     // Should the user have the ability to hide the banner?

This is discussed in the sections on Handle Deep Link and Routing below.\n(Optional) Configuring the Client for Deep LinkingInstalling the SDKFor iOS, the easiest way to install the SDK is via Cocoapods. Add pod \"Branch\" to your podfile and run pod install from the command line.However, if you don’t currently use Cocoapods, you can easily download and install our SDK. To download an open-source copy, grab the zip here.You will need to drag and drop the Branch.framework file that you downloaded into your project. Be sure that “Copy items if needed” is selected.\n        \n      You also need to import CoreTelephony. See the graphic here.   Most accurate matching\nTo get the best experience with Branch, you should import AdSupport.framework. This allows us to leverage the IDFA for more accurate matching, and we can also identify users who return later after uninstalling the app.\nBranch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to YourProject-Info.plist (Info.plist for Swift).\n  In plist file, mouse hover “Information Property List” which is the root item under the Key column.\n  After about half a second, you will see a “+” sign appear. Click it.\n  In the newly added row, fill in “branch_key” for its key, leave type as String, and enter your app key obtained in above steps in its value column.\n  Save the plist file.\nAnimated Gif\n        \n      URI SchemeTo set up your URI Scheme, you’ll need to open your project in XCode and complete the following.\n  Click on YourProject-Info.plist on the left (or in Swift, Info.plist).\n  Find URL Types and click the right arrow. (If it doesn’t exist, right click anywhere and choose Add Row. Scroll down and choose URL Types)\n  Add myapp, where myapp is a unique string for your app, as an item in URL Schemes as below:\nGo do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.The deepLinkHandler is a block of code that executes when a Branch session is successfully initialized, as well as anytime a user clicks a link to your app. This is the central place where you define how your app should respond to links.When a user clicks a Branch link and your app opens, the Branch SDK contacts the Branch servers to see whether this user opening your app is the same one who just clicked the link. If it is, then the params dictionary that you see below will be populated with any data attached to a Branch link if a user just clicked one.The initSession call is an asynchronous call and any other calls will be queued up to complete after the server returns a response.For Swift, you will need to add a bridging header in order to use Branch in your project’s files. For help on adding a bridging header, see this StackOverflow answer.There are a few pieces that must be in place. First, open your project’s AppDelegate.m (or AppDelegate.swift) file.\n  Add #import \"Branch.h\" at the top of the file (Objective-C only)\n  Find the line which reads:\n\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\nobjective-cswiftand paste the following right below it:\n\nBranch *branch = [Branch getInstance];\n[branch initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) {\n        // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n        // params will be empty if no data found\n        // ... insert custom logic here ...\n        NSLog(@\"params: %@\", params.description)\n    }\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   initSession is called 100% of the time\ninitSession is always called, whether or not the user clicked on a Branch link. If no Branch link was clicked, params will come back empty. Plan your application logic accordingly!\nNOTE If you are seeing a “Branch.h file not found” error but you’ve imported the SDK, or it’s breaking during compiling–and you’re using Xcode 6.3 or newer–click here.Branch-provided data parameters in callbackPreviously, Branch did not return any information to the app if initSession was called but the user hadn’t clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.\n  ~ denotes analytics\n  + denotes information added by Branch\n  (for the curious, $ denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)\n\n  \n    \n      Parameter\n      Meaning\n    \n    \n      ~channel\n      The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~feature\n      The feature, such as invite or share, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~tags\n      Any tags, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~campaign\n      The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~stage\n      The stage, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~creation_source\n      Where the link was created (‘API’, ‘Dashboard’, ‘SDK’, ‘iOS SDK’, ‘Android SDK’, or ‘Web SDK’)\n    \n    \n      +referrer\n      The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked\n    \n    \n      +phone_number\n      The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app\n    \n    \n      +is_first_session\n      Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)\n    \n    \n      +clicked_branch_link\n      Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session\n    \n  \nHandle Deep LinkIn order for your app to properly handle deep links, and to allow Branch to work its magic and call the deepLinkHandler, you will need to add the following code within application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation::\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {\n    // pass the url to the handle deep link call\n    if (![[Branch getInstance] handleDeepLink:url]) {\n        // do other deep link routing for the Facebook SDK, Pinterest SDK, etc\n    }\n    return YES;\n}\n\nobjective-cswiftRouting to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside of the deepLinkHandler, you will want to examine the params dictionary to determine whether the user clicked on a link to content. Regardless of whether your app involves pictures, videos, text or whatever novel content your app contains, you likely have an internal system of identifiers.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures and each one is tagged with a picture Id. When a user shares a picture, simply attach a picture Id to the Branch link being created. If a user clicks a link to a specific picture, this Id will show up in the params dictionary in the deepLinkHandler.- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\n  // initialize the session, setup a deep link handler\n  [[Branch getInstance] initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions\n                          andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n\n    // start setting up the view controller hierarchy\n    UINavigationController *navC = (UINavigationController *)self.window.rootViewController;\n    UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"Main\" bundle:nil];\n    UIViewController *nextVC;\n    // If the key 'pictureId' is present in the deep link dictionary\n    // then load the picture screen with the appropriate picture\n    NSString *pictureId = [params objectForKey:@\"pictureId\"];\n    if (pictureId) {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"PicVC\"];\n      [nextVC setNextPictureId:pictureId];\n    } else {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"MainVC\"];\n    }\n    [navC setViewControllers:@[nextVC] animated:YES];\n  }];\n\n  return YES;\n}(Optional) Routing: passing information from the BannerNow that you’ve added routing to your app, you can add information to the Smart Banner.

Add pod \"Branch\" to your podfile and run pod install from the command line.However, if you don’t currently use Cocoapods, you can easily download and install our SDK.

(If it doesn’t exist, right click anywhere and choose Add Row. Scroll down and choose URL Types)\n  Add myapp, where myapp is a unique string for your app, as an item in URL Schemes as below:\nGo do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.The deepLinkHandler is a block of code that executes when a Branch session is successfully initialized, as well as anytime a user clicks a link to your app. This is the central place where you define how your app should respond to links.When a user clicks a Branch link and your app opens, the Branch SDK contacts the Branch servers to see whether this user opening your app is the same one who just clicked the link. If it is, then the params dictionary that you see below will be populated with any data attached to a Branch link if a user just clicked one.The initSession call is an asynchronous call and any other calls will be queued up to complete after the server returns a response.For Swift, you will need to add a bridging header in order to use Branch in your project’s files. For help on adding a bridging header, see this StackOverflow answer.There are a few pieces that must be in place. First, open your project’s AppDelegate.m (or AppDelegate.swift) file.\n  Add #import \"Branch.h\" at the top of the file (Objective-C only)\n  Find the line which reads:\n\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\nobjective-cswiftand paste the following right below it:\n\nBranch *branch = [Branch getInstance];\n[branch initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) {\n        // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n        // params will be empty if no data found\n        // ... insert custom logic here ...\n        NSLog(@\"params: %@\", params.description)\n    }\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   initSession is called 100% of the time\ninitSession is always called, whether or not the user clicked on a Branch link. If no Branch link was clicked, params will come back empty. Plan your application logic accordingly!\nNOTE If you are seeing a “Branch.h file not found” error but you’ve imported the SDK, or it’s breaking during compiling–and you’re using Xcode 6.3 or newer–click here.Branch-provided data parameters in callbackPreviously, Branch did not return any information to the app if initSession was called but the user hadn’t clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.\n  ~ denotes analytics\n  + denotes information added by Branch\n  (for the curious, $ denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)\n\n  \n    \n      Parameter\n      Meaning\n    \n    \n      ~channel\n      The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~feature\n      The feature, such as invite or share, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~tags\n      Any tags, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~campaign\n      The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~stage\n      The stage, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~creation_source\n      Where the link was created (‘API’, ‘Dashboard’, ‘SDK’, ‘iOS SDK’, ‘Android SDK’, or ‘Web SDK’)\n    \n    \n      +referrer\n      The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked\n    \n    \n      +phone_number\n      The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app\n    \n    \n      +is_first_session\n      Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)\n    \n    \n      +clicked_branch_link\n      Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session\n    \n  \nHandle Deep LinkIn order for your app to properly handle deep links, and to allow Branch to work its magic and call the deepLinkHandler, you will need to add the following code within application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation::\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {\n    // pass the url to the handle deep link call\n    if (![[Branch getInstance] handleDeepLink:url]) {\n        // do other deep link routing for the Facebook SDK, Pinterest SDK, etc\n    }\n    return YES;\n}\n\nobjective-cswiftRouting to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside of the deepLinkHandler, you will want to examine the params dictionary to determine whether the user clicked on a link to content. Regardless of whether your app involves pictures, videos, text or whatever novel content your app contains, you likely have an internal system of identifiers.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures and each one is tagged with a picture Id. When a user shares a picture, simply attach a picture Id to the Branch link being created. If a user clicks a link to a specific picture, this Id will show up in the params dictionary in the deepLinkHandler.- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\n  // initialize the session, setup a deep link handler\n  [[Branch getInstance] initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions\n                          andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n\n    // start setting up the view controller hierarchy\n    UINavigationController *navC = (UINavigationController *)self.window.rootViewController;\n    UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"Main\" bundle:nil];\n    UIViewController *nextVC;\n    // If the key 'pictureId' is present in the deep link dictionary\n    // then load the picture screen with the appropriate picture\n    NSString *pictureId = [params objectForKey:@\"pictureId\"];\n    if (pictureId) {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"PicVC\"];\n      [nextVC setNextPictureId:pictureId];\n    } else {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"MainVC\"];\n    }\n    [navC setViewControllers:@[nextVC] animated:YES];\n  }];\n\n  return YES;\n}(Optional) Routing: passing information from the BannerNow that you’ve added routing to your app, you can add information to the Smart Banner. If you’ve used the example Smart Banner code above, you simply need to insert any key-value pairs you’d like into the data dictionary.Using our example of routing above with the PicVC, you’d simply need to change the Web Banner code to the following:branch.banner(options, {\n    phone: '9999999999',\n    type: 1,\n    data: {\n        'pictureId': '12345',\n    }\n});Now when a user clicks on the Smart Banner on a mobile device, when they open your app they will be taken straight to a view controller to see picture with id “12345”. It’s that simple.Deep linking has countless possibilities and we’d be happy to brainstorm use cases for your specific app. Happy building!ConclusionYou’ve learned how to add a smart banner to your website with minimal configuration and some copying-and-pasting Javascript into your website. Perhaps the allure of passing data through install or deep linking to content caught your eye and you added the SDK to your iOS app. There’s a ton more that Branch can do. For example, you can:\n  \n    Referrals with incentives – reward users based on the installs or engagement they generate\n  \n  \n    Personalized welcome – tailor onboarding for your users\n  \n  \n    See a list of your top influencers whose shared links are driving the most installs\n  \n  \n    Specify the channel (Facebook, Email, etc.) or tag content as it is being shared – then you can see a breakdown of installs by tag on the Dashboard\n  \nQuestions, comments and love letters are always welcome at support@branchmetrics.io."},{"title":"   Note:","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/app_download_banner/","body":"This field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works).  Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the App Store, it will go to this URL.

To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For iOS apps, the URI scheme can be specified in the .plist file under URL Types. If you haven’t added one to your iOS app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard!

If a user clicks a link to a specific picture, this Id will show up in the params dictionary in the deepLinkHandler.- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\n  // initialize the session, setup a deep link handler\n  [[Branch getInstance] initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions\n                          andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n\n    // start setting up the view controller hierarchy\n    UINavigationController *navC = (UINavigationController *)self.window.rootViewController;\n    UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"Main\" bundle:nil];\n    UIViewController *nextVC;\n    // If the key 'pictureId' is present in the deep link dictionary\n    // then load the picture screen with the appropriate picture\n    NSString *pictureId = [params objectForKey:@\"pictureId\"];\n    if (pictureId) {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"PicVC\"];\n      [nextVC setNextPictureId:pictureId];\n    } else {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"MainVC\"];\n    }\n    [navC setViewControllers:@[nextVC] animated:YES];\n  }];\n\n  return YES;\n}(Optional) Routing: passing information from the BannerNow that you’ve added routing to your app, you can add information to the Smart Banner. If you’ve used the example Smart Banner code above, you simply need to insert any key-value pairs you’d like into the data dictionary.Using our example of routing above with the PicVC, you’d simply need to change the Web Banner code to the following:branch.banner(options, {\n    phone: '9999999999',\n    type: 1,\n    data: {\n        'pictureId': '12345',\n    }\n});Now when a user clicks on the Smart Banner on a mobile device, when they open your app they will be taken straight to a view controller to see picture with id “12345”. It’s that simple.Deep linking has countless possibilities and we’d be happy to brainstorm use cases for your specific app. Happy building!ConclusionYou’ve learned how to add a smart banner to your website with minimal configuration and some copying-and-pasting Javascript into your website. Perhaps the allure of passing data through install or deep linking to content caught your eye and you added the SDK to your iOS app. There’s a ton more that Branch can do. For example, you can:\n  \n    Referrals with incentives – reward users based on the installs or engagement they generate\n  \n  \n    Personalized welcome – tailor onboarding for your users\n  \n  \n    See a list of your top influencers whose shared links are driving the most installs\n  \n  \n    Specify the channel (Facebook, Email, etc.) or tag content as it is being shared – then you can see a breakdown of installs by tag on the Dashboard\n  \nQuestions, comments and love letters are always welcome at support@branchmetrics.io."},{"title":"   This just works!","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/app_download_banner/","body":"This short snippet of code below is enough to add a web banner to both your desktop and mobile web pages!

This is discussed in the sections on Handle Deep Link and Routing below.\n(Optional) Configuring the Client for Deep LinkingInstalling the SDKFor iOS, the easiest way to install the SDK is via Cocoapods. Add pod \"Branch\" to your podfile and run pod install from the command line.However, if you don’t currently use Cocoapods, you can easily download and install our SDK. To download an open-source copy, grab the zip here.You will need to drag and drop the Branch.framework file that you downloaded into your project. Be sure that “Copy items if needed” is selected.\n        \n      You also need to import CoreTelephony. See the graphic here.   Most accurate matching\nTo get the best experience with Branch, you should import AdSupport.framework. This allows us to leverage the IDFA for more accurate matching, and we can also identify users who return later after uninstalling the app.\nBranch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to YourProject-Info.plist (Info.plist for Swift).\n  In plist file, mouse hover “Information Property List” which is the root item under the Key column.\n  After about half a second, you will see a “+” sign appear. Click it.\n  In the newly added row, fill in “branch_key” for its key, leave type as String, and enter your app key obtained in above steps in its value column.\n  Save the plist file.\nAnimated Gif\n        \n      URI SchemeTo set up your URI Scheme, you’ll need to open your project in XCode and complete the following.\n  Click on YourProject-Info.plist on the left (or in Swift, Info.plist).\n  Find URL Types and click the right arrow. (If it doesn’t exist, right click anywhere and choose Add Row. Scroll down and choose URL Types)\n  Add myapp, where myapp is a unique string for your app, as an item in URL Schemes as below:\nGo do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.The deepLinkHandler is a block of code that executes when a Branch session is successfully initialized, as well as anytime a user clicks a link to your app. This is the central place where you define how your app should respond to links.When a user clicks a Branch link and your app opens, the Branch SDK contacts the Branch servers to see whether this user opening your app is the same one who just clicked the link. If it is, then the params dictionary that you see below will be populated with any data attached to a Branch link if a user just clicked one.The initSession call is an asynchronous call and any other calls will be queued up to complete after the server returns a response.For Swift, you will need to add a bridging header in order to use Branch in your project’s files. For help on adding a bridging header, see this StackOverflow answer.There are a few pieces that must be in place.

There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.The deepLinkHandler is a block of code that executes when a Branch session is successfully initialized, as well as anytime a user clicks a link to your app. This is the central place where you define how your app should respond to links.When a user clicks a Branch link and your app opens, the Branch SDK contacts the Branch servers to see whether this user opening your app is the same one who just clicked the link. If it is, then the params dictionary that you see below will be populated with any data attached to a Branch link if a user just clicked one.The initSession call is an asynchronous call and any other calls will be queued up to complete after the server returns a response.For Swift, you will need to add a bridging header in order to use Branch in your project’s files. For help on adding a bridging header, see this StackOverflow answer.There are a few pieces that must be in place. First, open your project’s AppDelegate.m (or AppDelegate.swift) file.\n  Add #import \"Branch.h\" at the top of the file (Objective-C only)\n  Find the line which reads:\n\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\nobjective-cswiftand paste the following right below it:\n\nBranch *branch = [Branch getInstance];\n[branch initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) {\n        // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n        // params will be empty if no data found\n        // ... insert custom logic here ...\n        NSLog(@\"params: %@\", params.description)\n    }\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   initSession is called 100% of the time\ninitSession is always called, whether or not the user clicked on a Branch link.

That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside of the deepLinkHandler, you will want to examine the params dictionary to determine whether the user clicked on a link to content. Regardless of whether your app involves pictures, videos, text or whatever novel content your app contains, you likely have an internal system of identifiers.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures and each one is tagged with a picture Id. When a user shares a picture, simply attach a picture Id to the Branch link being created. If a user clicks a link to a specific picture, this Id will show up in the params dictionary in the deepLinkHandler.- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\n  // initialize the session, setup a deep link handler\n  [[Branch getInstance] initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions\n                          andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n\n    // start setting up the view controller hierarchy\n    UINavigationController *navC = (UINavigationController *)self.window.rootViewController;\n    UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"Main\" bundle:nil];\n    UIViewController *nextVC;\n    // If the key 'pictureId' is present in the deep link dictionary\n    // then load the picture screen with the appropriate picture\n    NSString *pictureId = [params objectForKey:@\"pictureId\"];\n    if (pictureId) {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"PicVC\"];\n      [nextVC setNextPictureId:pictureId];\n    } else {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"MainVC\"];\n    }\n    [navC setViewControllers:@[nextVC] animated:YES];\n  }];\n\n  return YES;\n}(Optional) Routing: passing information from the BannerNow that you’ve added routing to your app, you can add information to the Smart Banner. If you’ve used the example Smart Banner code above, you simply need to insert any key-value pairs you’d like into the data dictionary.Using our example of routing above with the PicVC, you’d simply need to change the Web Banner code to the following:branch.banner(options, {\n    phone: '9999999999',\n    type: 1,\n    data: {\n        'pictureId': '12345',\n    }\n});Now when a user clicks on the Smart Banner on a mobile device, when they open your app they will be taken straight to a view controller to see picture with id “12345”.

However, if you’ve already completed Step 1 of our quickstart guide, Integrating the SDK, then you can skip Step 1! Jump to Step 2, The Smart Banner. (You can also skip optional Step 3, Configuring the Client, if you’ve performed this step from the quickstart guide.)\nThe mobile web smart banner is a powerful tool–it brings users in from the web experience where they are more easily lost, to your native mobile experience. On desktop, the banner can even drive users to mobile via our text-me-the-app function.It’s highly customizable. If you want simple, cross-platform download links that just work, follow the first two sections on configuring the dashboard and The Smart Banner.If you also want to pass data through the install process or deep link straight to content, check out the optional 3rd and 4th sections on Configuring the Client for Deep Linking and Routing: passing information from the Banner.Configuring the Dashboard for your Android appApp NameTo get started, point your browser to https://dashboard.branch.io/. If you haven’t created an account before, you should sign up and complete the basic setup. If you’ve signed up already, navigate to the Summary page and click the dropdown button in the top right. Choose “Create new app.” You will be prompted to enter a name for your new app. Do so and press “Create.”Web URL\n        \n      This is where we will take users who click a Branch link if we don’t know where else to take them. For example, if you don’t have an Android app released yet, Android users will be taken to this link. Don’t forget to Save!To configure the Web URL on an existing app, you will need to navigate to the Settings > Link Settings page on the Dashboard. Scroll down to Default URL and enter your website.   Tip:\nYou can customize this fallback URL on a per-platform or even per-link basis. After completing setup, you may want to check out our section on Custom Redirects.\nPlay Store or custom URL\n        \n      Part of the magic of Branch Links is that you can have different configurations for iOS, Android, Fire… – and it just works! In this section, you need to specify where the user can download your app.When setting up an Android app, you need to locate your app in the Play Store. Start typing the name of your app and it should show up in the box.You may be wondering–what if I can’t find my app, or it isn’t on the Play Store yet? Good news: you can specify any location you want. For Android Apps, you can specify the URL of your APK file. Hosting on Dropbox or crashlytics works fine, just as long as it’s the .apk itself you’re linking to. For Android, we require the package name appended to this custom URL as we set the intent accordingly and allow a deeplink simulation whether it’s the first download or any consequent deeplink to a non play-store URL.   Note:\nThis field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works). Please be sure to enter your package name as well! Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the Play Store, it will go to this URL. Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Eclipse or Android Studio.\nURI Scheme\n        \n      Note: this is required if you want your smart banner to open the app. If, however, you simply want a banner that links to the Play Store (on mobile) or that allows users to text themselves the app (on desktop), you can skip this step.Setting the URI scheme is not strictly required if you are only going to use Branch to measure the number of clicks for a given link. To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For Android apps, the URI scheme can be specified in your project’s manifest file. If you haven’t added one to your Android app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard.The Smart Banner\n        \n      Branch offers a highly customizable smart banner that works across platforms. Android and iOS users can install or open the app from one banner. Users can even be deep linked to content! Desktop users can choose to text themselves the app.   This just works!\nThis short snippet of code below is enough to add a web banner to both your desktop and mobile web pages! Of course, you’ll want to configure it, so check out both the Smart Banner Options and Link Options below.\nAfter configuring your app on the Dashboard, you can simply add the following code somewhere inside the <head> </head> tags on your website. Note that the only thing you need to do is replace YOUR-BRANCH-KEY with your Branch Key inside the init() call.<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    (function(b,r,a,n,c,h,_,s,d,k){if(!b[n]||!b[n]._q){for(;s<_.length;)c(h,_[s++]);d=r.createElement(a);d.async=1;d.src=\"https://cdn.branch.io/branch-v1.5.6.min.js\";k=r.getElementsByTagName(a)[0];k.parentNode.insertBefore(d,k);b[n]=h}})(window,document,\"script\",\"branch\",function(b,r){b[r]=function(){b._q.push([r,arguments])}},{_q:[],_v:1},\"init data setIdentity logout track link sendSMS referrals credits creditHistory applyCode validateCode getCode redeem banner closeBanner\".split(\" \"),0);\n\nbranch.init('YOUR-BRANCH-KEY');\nbranch.banner({\n    icon: 'http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/wineass/ios7-redesign/512/Appstore-icon.png',\n    title: 'Branch Demo App',\n    description: 'The Branch demo app!'\n}, {});\n\n</script>You can find your Branch Key on the Dashboard’s Settings page.Closing the App Banner ProgrammaticallyThe App Banner includes a close button the user can click, but you may want to close the banner with a timeout, or via some other user interaction with your web app. In this case, closing the banner is very simple by calling Branch.closeBanner().js\nbranch.closeBanner();\nSmart Banner Options, Link OptionsThere are a lot of options here, but don’t be scared.

This is discussed in the sections on Handle Deep Link and Routing below.\n(Optional) Configuring the Client for Deep LinkingInstalling the SDKFor Android, the easiest way to add the SDK to your project is by adding the Branch SDK inside your project structure as a library dependency. Here are the steps:\n  Right click on the main module within your project (this is called ‘app’ by default).\n  Select Open Module Settings.\n  Within the Dependencies tab, click the + button at the bottom of the window and select Library Dependency.\n  Type branch, and hit the enter key to search Maven Central for the Branch SDK Library.\n  Select the latest io.branch.sdk.android:library item listed.\nIn case you’d like to use our .jar instead, here’s a link that always points to our latest.Finally, you can always clone our Android SDK project and import it into your workspace for maximum visibility.Branch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to your project workspace.\n  Navigate to to res/values/strings.xml\n  Navigate to AndroidManifest.xml and add the following <meta-data tag:\n<application>\n    <!-- Other existing entries -->\n\n    <!-- Add this meta-data below; DO NOT change the android:value -->\n    <meta-data android:name=\"io.branch.sdk.BranchKey\" android:value=\"key_live_jbgnjxvlhSb6PGH23BhO4hiflcp3y8kx\" />\n    <meta-data android:name=\"io.branch.sdk.BranchKey.test\" android:value=\"key_test_jkptOCZtmtxhOMZ11ynbXecdDCd93cbr\" />\n</application>URI SchemeOpen up Android Studio and navigate to your AndroidManifest.xml.You can register your app to respond to direct deep links (yourapp:// in a mobile browser) by adding the second intent filter block.<activity\n\tandroid:name=\"com.yourapp.SplashActivity\"\n\tandroid:label=\"@string/app_name\" >\n\t<intent-filter>\n\t\t<action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\" />\n\t</intent-filter>\n\t<!-- Add this intent filter below, and change yourapp to your app name -->\n\t<intent-filter>\n\t\t<data android:scheme=\"yourapp\" android:host=\"open\" />\n\t\t<action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" />\n\t</intent-filter>\n</activity>However, you can have many intent-filters. It all depends on how you architecht receiving intents inside your application.Go do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.NOTE This guide assumes that you’re familiar with the Android UI lifecycle. A single Branch object instance is used per Activity or Fragment, so declare an object at the class-level, and you can call this in every Activity or Fragment where you need to interact with Branch; if it has already be initialised elsewhere in your app, the same instance will be returned.Inside your onStart, do the following, where the variable branch is created in your base activity class (of type Branch).@Override\nprotected void onStart() {\n    super.onStart();\n    Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());\n    branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {\n            if (error == null) {\n                // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n                // params will be empty if no data found\n                // ... insert custom logic here ...\n            } else {\n                Log.i(\"MyApp\", error.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n    }, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n}Next, you’ll need to hook into the onNewIntent method specified inside the Activity lifecycle and set the intent. This is required for conformity with Facebook’s AppLinks. Verify that the activity you’re implementing has launchMode set to singleTask inside the Manifest declaration. Once that’d done, go to said activity and do something like the folllowing:@Override\npublic void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {\n    this.setIntent(intent);\n}Side note: This is a requirement because of the new Facebook AppLinks change. Facebook doesn’t open up the browser anymore and just calls the URI to open the app directly. This prevented Branch clicks from being registered. To support it, we pass that link click id through the URI scheme to Branch, and send that back to the app, creating a ‘click’ without actually seeing a click. Android does a very poor job of clearing out intents that were previously called, so this helps ensure that once a URI scheme is called and consumed, it won’t trigger deep linking anymore.branch.initSession(branchReferralInitListener, this.getIntent().getData(), this);NOTE if you’re calling this inside a fragment, please use getActivity() instead of passing in this. Also, this.getIntent().getData() refers to the data associated with an incoming intent.Branch-provided data parameters in callbackPreviously, Branch did not return any information to the app if initSession was called but the user hadn’t clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.\n  ~ denotes analytics\n  + denotes information added by Branch\n  (for the curious, $ denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)\n\n  \n    \n      Parameter\n      Meaning\n    \n    \n      ~channel\n      The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~feature\n      The feature, such as invite or share, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~tags\n      Any tags, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~campaign\n      The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~stage\n      The stage, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~creation_source\n      Where the link was created (‘API’, ‘Dashboard’, ‘SDK’, ‘iOS SDK’, ‘Android SDK’, or ‘Web SDK’)\n    \n    \n      +referrer\n      The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked\n    \n    \n      +phone_number\n      The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app\n    \n    \n      +is_first_session\n      Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)\n    \n    \n      +clicked_branch_link\n      Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session\n    \n  \nAutomatic Session ManagementStarting from Branch SDK version 1.5.7, there is no need for initialising and closing session with the new automatic session management. Automatic session management can work only with API level 14 and above, so make sure that your minSdkVersion is 14 or above.Requirement<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=\"14\" />Once you do any of the below, there is no need to close or init sessions in your Activities. Branch SDK will do all that for you. You can get your Branch instance at any time as follows.Branch branch = Branch.getInstance();Branch SDK can do session management for you if you do one of the following:Common: you do not use Application classIf you are not creating or using an Application class throughout your project, all you need to do is declare BranchApp as your application class in your manifest.<application android:name=\"io.branch.referal.BranchApp\">Rarer: you already use the Application classIf you already have an Application class then extend your application class with BranchApp.public class YourApplication extends BranchAppVery rare: you already use and extend the Application classIf you already have an Application class and don’t want to extend it from BranchApp then create a Branch instance in your Application’s onCreate() method.public void onCreate() {\n    super.onCreate();\n    if (!BuildConfig.DEBUG) {\n        Branch.getInstance(this);\n    } else {\n        Branch.getTestInstance(this);\n    }\n}Close session (session tracking to support for minSdkVersion < 14)Note: There is no need to use this method if you use automatic session management as described above and only support minSdkVersion >= 14Required: Every activity that will use Branch in some way should include Branch SDK methods in both onStart() and onStop(). Don’t forget closeSession() in every activity with Branch!@Override\nprotected void onStop() {\n    super.onStop();\n    branch.closeSession();\n}Handle Deep LinkInside Android, allow us to hook into your activities where you have declared and intent filter for deeplinking. During the onCreate portion of execution, you can add something like the following:branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener() {\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tIterator<?> keys = referringParams.keys();\n\t\t\twhile (keys.hasNext()) {\n\t\t\t\tString key = (String) keys.next();\n\t\t\t\tLog.i(\"Branch Link\", key + \", \" + referringParams.getString(key));\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t// iterate through keys and start an Activity.\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t} catch (JSONException e) {\n\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}, this.getIntent().getData(), this);Routing to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside onStart, when Branch is initialized, you will want to examine the dictionary we pass to you from our callback. This will allow you to know whether or not a link click with context was made. You’ll likely have many entry points based off different parameters.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures, and each picture has an ID. When user A decides to share a picture, attach that ID to the shortUrl or LongURL being created. When User B downloads (or opens the app if they already have it), the call to initSession will inform you of the parameters user A sent. Unpack em, and route away to the right view!@Override\npublic void onStart() {\n    super.onStart();\n\n    Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());\n    branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, Branch.BranchError error) {\n            if (error == null) {\n                // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked before showing up\n                // params will be empty if no data found\n                String pictureID = referringParams.optString(\"picture_id\", \"\");\n                if (pictureID.equals(\"\")) {\n                    startActivity(new Intent(this, HomeActivity.class));\n                }\n                else {\n                    Intent i = new Intent(this, ViewerActivity.class);\n                    i.putExtra(\"picture_id\", pictureID);\n                    startActivity(i);\n                }\n            } else {\n                Log.e(\"MyApp\", error.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n    }, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n    // if you want to specify isReferrable, then comment out the above line and uncomment this line:\n    // }, true, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n}(Optional) Routing: passing information from the BannerNow that you’ve added routing to your app, you can add information to the Smart Banner. If you’ve used the example Smart Banner code above, you simply need to insert any key-value pairs you’d like into the data dictionary.Using our example of routing above with the PicVC, you’d simply need to change the Web Banner code to the following:branch.banner(options, {\n    phone: '9999999999',\n    type: 1,\n    data: {\n        'pictureId': '12345',\n    }\n});Now when a user clicks on the Smart Banner on a mobile device, when they open your app they will be taken straight to a view controller to see picture with id “12345”. It’s that simple.Deep linking has countless possibilities and we’d be happy to brainstorm use cases for your specific app. Happy building!ConclusionYou’ve learned how to add a smart banner to your website with minimal configuration and some copying-and-pasting Javascript into your website. Perhaps the allure of passing data through install or deep linking to content caught your eye and you added the SDK to your Android app. There’s a ton more that Branch can do. For example, you can:\n  \n    Referrals with incentives – reward users based on the installs or engagement they generate\n  \n  \n    Personalized welcome – tailor onboarding for your users\n  \n  \n    See a list of your top influencers whose shared links are driving the most installs\n  \n  \n    Specify the channel (Facebook, Email, etc.) or tag content as it is being shared – then you can see a breakdown of installs by tag on the Dashboard\n  \nQuestions, comments and love letters are always welcome at support@branchmetrics.io."},{"title":"   Have you already integrated?","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/app_download_banner/android/","body":"This guide assumes that you haven’t already integrated Branch and provides full step-by-step instructions.

For example, if you don’t have an Android app released yet, Android users will be taken to this link. Don’t forget to Save!To configure the Web URL on an existing app, you will need to navigate to the Settings > Link Settings page on the Dashboard. Scroll down to Default URL and enter your website.   Tip:\nYou can customize this fallback URL on a per-platform or even per-link basis. After completing setup, you may want to check out our section on Custom Redirects.\nPlay Store or custom URL\n        \n      Part of the magic of Branch Links is that you can have different configurations for iOS, Android, Fire… – and it just works! In this section, you need to specify where the user can download your app.When setting up an Android app, you need to locate your app in the Play Store. Start typing the name of your app and it should show up in the box.You may be wondering–what if I can’t find my app, or it isn’t on the Play Store yet? Good news: you can specify any location you want. For Android Apps, you can specify the URL of your APK file. Hosting on Dropbox or crashlytics works fine, just as long as it’s the .apk itself you’re linking to. For Android, we require the package name appended to this custom URL as we set the intent accordingly and allow a deeplink simulation whether it’s the first download or any consequent deeplink to a non play-store URL.   Note:\nThis field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works). Please be sure to enter your package name as well! Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the Play Store, it will go to this URL. Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Eclipse or Android Studio.\nURI Scheme\n        \n      Note: this is required if you want your smart banner to open the app. If, however, you simply want a banner that links to the Play Store (on mobile) or that allows users to text themselves the app (on desktop), you can skip this step.Setting the URI scheme is not strictly required if you are only going to use Branch to measure the number of clicks for a given link. To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For Android apps, the URI scheme can be specified in your project’s manifest file. If you haven’t added one to your Android app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard.The Smart Banner\n        \n      Branch offers a highly customizable smart banner that works across platforms. Android and iOS users can install or open the app from one banner. Users can even be deep linked to content! Desktop users can choose to text themselves the app.   This just works!\nThis short snippet of code below is enough to add a web banner to both your desktop and mobile web pages! Of course, you’ll want to configure it, so check out both the Smart Banner Options and Link Options below.\nAfter configuring your app on the Dashboard, you can simply add the following code somewhere inside the <head> </head> tags on your website. Note that the only thing you need to do is replace YOUR-BRANCH-KEY with your Branch Key inside the init() call.<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    (function(b,r,a,n,c,h,_,s,d,k){if(!b[n]||!b[n]._q){for(;s<_.length;)c(h,_[s++]);d=r.createElement(a);d.async=1;d.src=\"https://cdn.branch.io/branch-v1.5.6.min.js\";k=r.getElementsByTagName(a)[0];k.parentNode.insertBefore(d,k);b[n]=h}})(window,document,\"script\",\"branch\",function(b,r){b[r]=function(){b._q.push([r,arguments])}},{_q:[],_v:1},\"init data setIdentity logout track link sendSMS referrals credits creditHistory applyCode validateCode getCode redeem banner closeBanner\".split(\" \"),0);\n\nbranch.init('YOUR-BRANCH-KEY');\nbranch.banner({\n    icon: 'http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/wineass/ios7-redesign/512/Appstore-icon.png',\n    title: 'Branch Demo App',\n    description: 'The Branch demo app!'\n}, {});\n\n</script>You can find your Branch Key on the Dashboard’s Settings page.Closing the App Banner ProgrammaticallyThe App Banner includes a close button the user can click, but you may want to close the banner with a timeout, or via some other user interaction with your web app. In this case, closing the banner is very simple by calling Branch.closeBanner().js\nbranch.closeBanner();\nSmart Banner Options, Link OptionsThere are a lot of options here, but don’t be scared.

This is discussed in the sections on Handle Deep Link and Routing below.\n(Optional) Configuring the Client for Deep LinkingInstalling the SDKFor Android, the easiest way to add the SDK to your project is by adding the Branch SDK inside your project structure as a library dependency. Here are the steps:\n  Right click on the main module within your project (this is called ‘app’ by default).\n  Select Open Module Settings.\n  Within the Dependencies tab, click the + button at the bottom of the window and select Library Dependency.\n  Type branch, and hit the enter key to search Maven Central for the Branch SDK Library.\n  Select the latest io.branch.sdk.android:library item listed.\nIn case you’d like to use our .jar instead, here’s a link that always points to our latest.Finally, you can always clone our Android SDK project and import it into your workspace for maximum visibility.Branch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to your project workspace.\n  Navigate to to res/values/strings.xml\n  Navigate to AndroidManifest.xml and add the following <meta-data tag:\n<application>\n    <!-- Other existing entries -->\n\n    <!-- Add this meta-data below; DO NOT change the android:value -->\n    <meta-data android:name=\"io.branch.sdk.BranchKey\" android:value=\"key_live_jbgnjxvlhSb6PGH23BhO4hiflcp3y8kx\" />\n    <meta-data android:name=\"io.branch.sdk.BranchKey.test\" android:value=\"key_test_jkptOCZtmtxhOMZ11ynbXecdDCd93cbr\" />\n</application>URI SchemeOpen up Android Studio and navigate to your AndroidManifest.xml.You can register your app to respond to direct deep links (yourapp:// in a mobile browser) by adding the second intent filter block.<activity\n\tandroid:name=\"com.yourapp.SplashActivity\"\n\tandroid:label=\"@string/app_name\" >\n\t<intent-filter>\n\t\t<action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\" />\n\t</intent-filter>\n\t<!-- Add this intent filter below, and change yourapp to your app name -->\n\t<intent-filter>\n\t\t<data android:scheme=\"yourapp\" android:host=\"open\" />\n\t\t<action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" />\n\t</intent-filter>\n</activity>However, you can have many intent-filters.

Automatic session management can work only with API level 14 and above, so make sure that your minSdkVersion is 14 or above.Requirement<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=\"14\" />Once you do any of the below, there is no need to close or init sessions in your Activities. Branch SDK will do all that for you. You can get your Branch instance at any time as follows.Branch branch = Branch.getInstance();Branch SDK can do session management for you if you do one of the following:Common: you do not use Application classIf you are not creating or using an Application class throughout your project, all you need to do is declare BranchApp as your application class in your manifest.<application android:name=\"io.branch.referal.BranchApp\">Rarer: you already use the Application classIf you already have an Application class then extend your application class with BranchApp.public class YourApplication extends BranchAppVery rare: you already use and extend the Application classIf you already have an Application class and don’t want to extend it from BranchApp then create a Branch instance in your Application’s onCreate() method.public void onCreate() {\n    super.onCreate();\n    if (!BuildConfig.DEBUG) {\n        Branch.getInstance(this);\n    } else {\n        Branch.getTestInstance(this);\n    }\n}Close session (session tracking to support for minSdkVersion < 14)Note: There is no need to use this method if you use automatic session management as described above and only support minSdkVersion >= 14Required: Every activity that will use Branch in some way should include Branch SDK methods in both onStart() and onStop(). Don’t forget closeSession() in every activity with Branch!@Override\nprotected void onStop() {\n    super.onStop();\n    branch.closeSession();\n}Handle Deep LinkInside Android, allow us to hook into your activities where you have declared and intent filter for deeplinking. During the onCreate portion of execution, you can add something like the following:branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener() {\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tIterator<?> keys = referringParams.keys();\n\t\t\twhile (keys.hasNext()) {\n\t\t\t\tString key = (String) keys.next();\n\t\t\t\tLog.i(\"Branch Link\", key + \", \" + referringParams.getString(key));\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t// iterate through keys and start an Activity.\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t} catch (JSONException e) {\n\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}, this.getIntent().getData(), this);Routing to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside onStart, when Branch is initialized, you will want to examine the dictionary we pass to you from our callback. This will allow you to know whether or not a link click with context was made. You’ll likely have many entry points based off different parameters.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures, and each picture has an ID. When user A decides to share a picture, attach that ID to the shortUrl or LongURL being created. When User B downloads (or opens the app if they already have it), the call to initSession will inform you of the parameters user A sent. Unpack em, and route away to the right view!@Override\npublic void onStart() {\n    super.onStart();\n\n    Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());\n    branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, Branch.BranchError error) {\n            if (error == null) {\n                // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked before showing up\n                // params will be empty if no data found\n                String pictureID = referringParams.optString(\"picture_id\", \"\");\n                if (pictureID.equals(\"\")) {\n                    startActivity(new Intent(this, HomeActivity.class));\n                }\n                else {\n                    Intent i = new Intent(this, ViewerActivity.class);\n                    i.putExtra(\"picture_id\", pictureID);\n                    startActivity(i);\n                }\n            } else {\n                Log.e(\"MyApp\", error.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n    }, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n    // if you want to specify isReferrable, then comment out the above line and uncomment this line:\n    // }, true, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n}(Optional) Routing: passing information from the BannerNow that you’ve added routing to your app, you can add information to the Smart Banner. If you’ve used the example Smart Banner code above, you simply need to insert any key-value pairs you’d like into the data dictionary.Using our example of routing above with the PicVC, you’d simply need to change the Web Banner code to the following:branch.banner(options, {\n    phone: '9999999999',\n    type: 1,\n    data: {\n        'pictureId': '12345',\n    }\n});Now when a user clicks on the Smart Banner on a mobile device, when they open your app they will be taken straight to a view controller to see picture with id “12345”. It’s that simple.Deep linking has countless possibilities and we’d be happy to brainstorm use cases for your specific app. Happy building!ConclusionYou’ve learned how to add a smart banner to your website with minimal configuration and some copying-and-pasting Javascript into your website. Perhaps the allure of passing data through install or deep linking to content caught your eye and you added the SDK to your Android app. There’s a ton more that Branch can do. For example, you can:\n  \n    Referrals with incentives – reward users based on the installs or engagement they generate\n  \n  \n    Personalized welcome – tailor onboarding for your users\n  \n  \n    See a list of your top influencers whose shared links are driving the most installs\n  \n  \n    Specify the channel (Facebook, Email, etc.) or tag content as it is being shared – then you can see a breakdown of installs by tag on the Dashboard\n  \nQuestions, comments and love letters are always welcome at support@branchmetrics.io."},{"title":"   Tip:","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/app_download_banner/android/","body":"You can customize this fallback URL on a per-platform or even per-link basis. After completing setup, you may want to check out our section on Custom Redirects."},{"title":"Play Store or custom URL","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/app_download_banner/android/#play-store-or-custom-url","body":"\n        \n      Part of the magic of Branch Links is that you can have different configurations for iOS, Android, Fire… – and it just works! In this section, you need to specify where the user can download your app.When setting up an Android app, you need to locate your app in the Play Store. Start typing the name of your app and it should show up in the box.You may be wondering–what if I can’t find my app, or it isn’t on the Play Store yet? Good news: you can specify any location you want. For Android Apps, you can specify the URL of your APK file. Hosting on Dropbox or crashlytics works fine, just as long as it’s the .apk itself you’re linking to. For Android, we require the package name appended to this custom URL as we set the intent accordingly and allow a deeplink simulation whether it’s the first download or any consequent deeplink to a non play-store URL.   Note:\nThis field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works). Please be sure to enter your package name as well! Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the Play Store, it will go to this URL. Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Eclipse or Android Studio.\nURI Scheme\n        \n      Note: this is required if you want your smart banner to open the app. If, however, you simply want a banner that links to the Play Store (on mobile) or that allows users to text themselves the app (on desktop), you can skip this step.Setting the URI scheme is not strictly required if you are only going to use Branch to measure the number of clicks for a given link. To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For Android apps, the URI scheme can be specified in your project’s manifest file. If you haven’t added one to your Android app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard.The Smart Banner\n        \n      Branch offers a highly customizable smart banner that works across platforms. Android and iOS users can install or open the app from one banner. Users can even be deep linked to content! Desktop users can choose to text themselves the app.   This just works!\nThis short snippet of code below is enough to add a web banner to both your desktop and mobile web pages! Of course, you’ll want to configure it, so check out both the Smart Banner Options and Link Options below.\nAfter configuring your app on the Dashboard, you can simply add the following code somewhere inside the <head> </head> tags on your website. Note that the only thing you need to do is replace YOUR-BRANCH-KEY with your Branch Key inside the init() call.<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    (function(b,r,a,n,c,h,_,s,d,k){if(!b[n]||!b[n]._q){for(;s<_.length;)c(h,_[s++]);d=r.createElement(a);d.async=1;d.src=\"https://cdn.branch.io/branch-v1.5.6.min.js\";k=r.getElementsByTagName(a)[0];k.parentNode.insertBefore(d,k);b[n]=h}})(window,document,\"script\",\"branch\",function(b,r){b[r]=function(){b._q.push([r,arguments])}},{_q:[],_v:1},\"init data setIdentity logout track link sendSMS referrals credits creditHistory applyCode validateCode getCode redeem banner closeBanner\".split(\" \"),0);\n\nbranch.init('YOUR-BRANCH-KEY');\nbranch.banner({\n    icon: 'http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/wineass/ios7-redesign/512/Appstore-icon.png',\n    title: 'Branch Demo App',\n    description: 'The Branch demo app!'\n}, {});\n\n</script>You can find your Branch Key on the Dashboard’s Settings page.Closing the App Banner ProgrammaticallyThe App Banner includes a close button the user can click, but you may want to close the banner with a timeout, or via some other user interaction with your web app. In this case, closing the banner is very simple by calling Branch.closeBanner().js\nbranch.closeBanner();\nSmart Banner Options, Link OptionsThere are a lot of options here, but don’t be scared.

This is discussed in the sections on Handle Deep Link and Routing below.\n(Optional) Configuring the Client for Deep LinkingInstalling the SDKFor Android, the easiest way to add the SDK to your project is by adding the Branch SDK inside your project structure as a library dependency. Here are the steps:\n  Right click on the main module within your project (this is called ‘app’ by default).\n  Select Open Module Settings.\n  Within the Dependencies tab, click the + button at the bottom of the window and select Library Dependency.\n  Type branch, and hit the enter key to search Maven Central for the Branch SDK Library.\n  Select the latest io.branch.sdk.android:library item listed.\nIn case you’d like to use our .jar instead, here’s a link that always points to our latest.Finally, you can always clone our Android SDK project and import it into your workspace for maximum visibility.Branch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to your project workspace.\n  Navigate to to res/values/strings.xml\n  Navigate to AndroidManifest.xml and add the following <meta-data tag:\n<application>\n    <!-- Other existing entries -->\n\n    <!-- Add this meta-data below; DO NOT change the android:value -->\n    <meta-data android:name=\"io.branch.sdk.BranchKey\" android:value=\"key_live_jbgnjxvlhSb6PGH23BhO4hiflcp3y8kx\" />\n    <meta-data android:name=\"io.branch.sdk.BranchKey.test\" android:value=\"key_test_jkptOCZtmtxhOMZ11ynbXecdDCd93cbr\" />\n</application>URI SchemeOpen up Android Studio and navigate to your AndroidManifest.xml.You can register your app to respond to direct deep links (yourapp:// in a mobile browser) by adding the second intent filter block.<activity\n\tandroid:name=\"com.yourapp.SplashActivity\"\n\tandroid:label=\"@string/app_name\" >\n\t<intent-filter>\n\t\t<action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\" />\n\t</intent-filter>\n\t<!-- Add this intent filter below, and change yourapp to your app name -->\n\t<intent-filter>\n\t\t<data android:scheme=\"yourapp\" android:host=\"open\" />\n\t\t<action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" />\n\t</intent-filter>\n</activity>However, you can have many intent-filters. It all depends on how you architecht receiving intents inside your application.Go do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.NOTE This guide assumes that you’re familiar with the Android UI lifecycle. A single Branch object instance is used per Activity or Fragment, so declare an object at the class-level, and you can call this in every Activity or Fragment where you need to interact with Branch; if it has already be initialised elsewhere in your app, the same instance will be returned.Inside your onStart, do the following, where the variable branch is created in your base activity class (of type Branch).@Override\nprotected void onStart() {\n    super.onStart();\n    Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());\n    branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {\n            if (error == null) {\n                // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n                // params will be empty if no data found\n                // ... insert custom logic here ...\n            } else {\n                Log.i(\"MyApp\", error.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n    }, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n}Next, you’ll need to hook into the onNewIntent method specified inside the Activity lifecycle and set the intent. This is required for conformity with Facebook’s AppLinks. Verify that the activity you’re implementing has launchMode set to singleTask inside the Manifest declaration. Once that’d done, go to said activity and do something like the folllowing:@Override\npublic void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {\n    this.setIntent(intent);\n}Side note: This is a requirement because of the new Facebook AppLinks change. Facebook doesn’t open up the browser anymore and just calls the URI to open the app directly. This prevented Branch clicks from being registered. To support it, we pass that link click id through the URI scheme to Branch, and send that back to the app, creating a ‘click’ without actually seeing a click. Android does a very poor job of clearing out intents that were previously called, so this helps ensure that once a URI scheme is called and consumed, it won’t trigger deep linking anymore.branch.initSession(branchReferralInitListener, this.getIntent().getData(), this);NOTE if you’re calling this inside a fragment, please use getActivity() instead of passing in this. Also, this.getIntent().getData() refers to the data associated with an incoming intent.Branch-provided data parameters in callbackPreviously, Branch did not return any information to the app if initSession was called but the user hadn’t clicked on a link.

To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For Android apps, the URI scheme can be specified in your project’s manifest file. If you haven’t added one to your Android app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard!

This is discussed in the sections on Handle Deep Link and Routing below.\n(Optional) Configuring the Client for Deep LinkingInstalling the SDKFor Android, the easiest way to add the SDK to your project is by adding the Branch SDK inside your project structure as a library dependency. Here are the steps:\n  Right click on the main module within your project (this is called ‘app’ by default).\n  Select Open Module Settings.\n  Within the Dependencies tab, click the + button at the bottom of the window and select Library Dependency.\n  Type branch, and hit the enter key to search Maven Central for the Branch SDK Library.\n  Select the latest io.branch.sdk.android:library item listed.\nIn case you’d like to use our .jar instead, here’s a link that always points to our latest.Finally, you can always clone our Android SDK project and import it into your workspace for maximum visibility.Branch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to your project workspace.\n  Navigate to to res/values/strings.xml\n  Navigate to AndroidManifest.xml and add the following <meta-data tag:\n<application>\n    <!-- Other existing entries -->\n\n    <!-- Add this meta-data below; DO NOT change the android:value -->\n    <meta-data android:name=\"io.branch.sdk.BranchKey\" android:value=\"key_live_jbgnjxvlhSb6PGH23BhO4hiflcp3y8kx\" />\n    <meta-data android:name=\"io.branch.sdk.BranchKey.test\" android:value=\"key_test_jkptOCZtmtxhOMZ11ynbXecdDCd93cbr\" />\n</application>URI SchemeOpen up Android Studio and navigate to your AndroidManifest.xml.You can register your app to respond to direct deep links (yourapp:// in a mobile browser) by adding the second intent filter block.<activity\n\tandroid:name=\"com.yourapp.SplashActivity\"\n\tandroid:label=\"@string/app_name\" >\n\t<intent-filter>\n\t\t<action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\" />\n\t</intent-filter>\n\t<!-- Add this intent filter below, and change yourapp to your app name -->\n\t<intent-filter>\n\t\t<data android:scheme=\"yourapp\" android:host=\"open\" />\n\t\t<action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" />\n\t</intent-filter>\n</activity>However, you can have many intent-filters. It all depends on how you architecht receiving intents inside your application.Go do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.NOTE This guide assumes that you’re familiar with the Android UI lifecycle. A single Branch object instance is used per Activity or Fragment, so declare an object at the class-level, and you can call this in every Activity or Fragment where you need to interact with Branch; if it has already be initialised elsewhere in your app, the same instance will be returned.Inside your onStart, do the following, where the variable branch is created in your base activity class (of type Branch).@Override\nprotected void onStart() {\n    super.onStart();\n    Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());\n    branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {\n            if (error == null) {\n                // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n                // params will be empty if no data found\n                // ... insert custom logic here ...\n            } else {\n                Log.i(\"MyApp\", error.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n    }, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n}Next, you’ll need to hook into the onNewIntent method specified inside the Activity lifecycle and set the intent. This is required for conformity with Facebook’s AppLinks. Verify that the activity you’re implementing has launchMode set to singleTask inside the Manifest declaration. Once that’d done, go to said activity and do something like the folllowing:@Override\npublic void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {\n    this.setIntent(intent);\n}Side note: This is a requirement because of the new Facebook AppLinks change. Facebook doesn’t open up the browser anymore and just calls the URI to open the app directly. This prevented Branch clicks from being registered. To support it, we pass that link click id through the URI scheme to Branch, and send that back to the app, creating a ‘click’ without actually seeing a click. Android does a very poor job of clearing out intents that were previously called, so this helps ensure that once a URI scheme is called and consumed, it won’t trigger deep linking anymore.branch.initSession(branchReferralInitListener, this.getIntent().getData(), this);NOTE if you’re calling this inside a fragment, please use getActivity() instead of passing in this. Also, this.getIntent().getData() refers to the data associated with an incoming intent.Branch-provided data parameters in callbackPreviously, Branch did not return any information to the app if initSession was called but the user hadn’t clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.\n  ~ denotes analytics\n  + denotes information added by Branch\n  (for the curious, $ denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)\n\n  \n    \n      Parameter\n      Meaning\n    \n    \n      ~channel\n      The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~feature\n      The feature, such as invite or share, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~tags\n      Any tags, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~campaign\n      The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~stage\n      The stage, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~creation_source\n      Where the link was created (‘API’, ‘Dashboard’, ‘SDK’, ‘iOS SDK’, ‘Android SDK’, or ‘Web SDK’)\n    \n    \n      +referrer\n      The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked\n    \n    \n      +phone_number\n      The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app\n    \n    \n      +is_first_session\n      Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)\n    \n    \n      +clicked_branch_link\n      Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session\n    \n  \nAutomatic Session ManagementStarting from Branch SDK version 1.5.7, there is no need for initialising and closing session with the new automatic session management. Automatic session management can work only with API level 14 and above, so make sure that your minSdkVersion is 14 or above.Requirement<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=\"14\" />Once you do any of the below, there is no need to close or init sessions in your Activities. Branch SDK will do all that for you. You can get your Branch instance at any time as follows.Branch branch = Branch.getInstance();Branch SDK can do session management for you if you do one of the following:Common: you do not use Application classIf you are not creating or using an Application class throughout your project, all you need to do is declare BranchApp as your application class in your manifest.<application android:name=\"io.branch.referal.BranchApp\">Rarer: you already use the Application classIf you already have an Application class then extend your application class with BranchApp.public class YourApplication extends BranchAppVery rare: you already use and extend the Application classIf you already have an Application class and don’t want to extend it from BranchApp then create a Branch instance in your Application’s onCreate() method.public void onCreate() {\n    super.onCreate();\n    if (!BuildConfig.DEBUG) {\n        Branch.getInstance(this);\n    } else {\n        Branch.getTestInstance(this);\n    }\n}Close session (session tracking to support for minSdkVersion < 14)Note: There is no need to use this method if you use automatic session management as described above and only support minSdkVersion >= 14Required: Every activity that will use Branch in some way should include Branch SDK methods in both onStart() and onStop(). Don’t forget closeSession() in every activity with Branch!@Override\nprotected void onStop() {\n    super.onStop();\n    branch.closeSession();\n}Handle Deep LinkInside Android, allow us to hook into your activities where you have declared and intent filter for deeplinking. During the onCreate portion of execution, you can add something like the following:branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener() {\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tIterator<?> keys = referringParams.keys();\n\t\t\twhile (keys.hasNext()) {\n\t\t\t\tString key = (String) keys.next();\n\t\t\t\tLog.i(\"Branch Link\", key + \", \" + referringParams.getString(key));\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t// iterate through keys and start an Activity.\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t} catch (JSONException e) {\n\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}, this.getIntent().getData(), this);Routing to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside onStart, when Branch is initialized, you will want to examine the dictionary we pass to you from our callback. This will allow you to know whether or not a link click with context was made. You’ll likely have many entry points based off different parameters.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures, and each picture has an ID. When user A decides to share a picture, attach that ID to the shortUrl or LongURL being created. When User B downloads (or opens the app if they already have it), the call to initSession will inform you of the parameters user A sent. Unpack em, and route away to the right view!@Override\npublic void onStart() {\n    super.onStart();\n\n    Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());\n    branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, Branch.BranchError error) {\n            if (error == null) {\n                // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked before showing up\n                // params will be empty if no data found\n                String pictureID = referringParams.optString(\"picture_id\", \"\");\n                if (pictureID.equals(\"\")) {\n                    startActivity(new Intent(this, HomeActivity.class));\n                }\n                else {\n                    Intent i = new Intent(this, ViewerActivity.class);\n                    i.putExtra(\"picture_id\", pictureID);\n                    startActivity(i);\n                }\n            } else {\n                Log.e(\"MyApp\", error.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n    }, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n    // if you want to specify isReferrable, then comment out the above line and uncomment this line:\n    // }, true, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n}(Optional) Routing: passing information from the BannerNow that you’ve added routing to your app, you can add information to the Smart Banner.

This is discussed in the sections on Handle Deep Link and Routing below.\n(Optional) Configuring the Client for Deep LinkingInstalling the SDKFor Android, the easiest way to add the SDK to your project is by adding the Branch SDK inside your project structure as a library dependency. Here are the steps:\n  Right click on the main module within your project (this is called ‘app’ by default).\n  Select Open Module Settings.\n  Within the Dependencies tab, click the + button at the bottom of the window and select Library Dependency.\n  Type branch, and hit the enter key to search Maven Central for the Branch SDK Library.\n  Select the latest io.branch.sdk.android:library item listed.\nIn case you’d like to use our .jar instead, here’s a link that always points to our latest.Finally, you can always clone our Android SDK project and import it into your workspace for maximum visibility.Branch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to your project workspace.\n  Navigate to to res/values/strings.xml\n  Navigate to AndroidManifest.xml and add the following <meta-data tag:\n<application>\n    <!-- Other existing entries -->\n\n    <!-- Add this meta-data below; DO NOT change the android:value -->\n    <meta-data android:name=\"io.branch.sdk.BranchKey\" android:value=\"key_live_jbgnjxvlhSb6PGH23BhO4hiflcp3y8kx\" />\n    <meta-data android:name=\"io.branch.sdk.BranchKey.test\" android:value=\"key_test_jkptOCZtmtxhOMZ11ynbXecdDCd93cbr\" />\n</application>URI SchemeOpen up Android Studio and navigate to your AndroidManifest.xml.You can register your app to respond to direct deep links (yourapp:// in a mobile browser) by adding the second intent filter block.<activity\n\tandroid:name=\"com.yourapp.SplashActivity\"\n\tandroid:label=\"@string/app_name\" >\n\t<intent-filter>\n\t\t<action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\" />\n\t</intent-filter>\n\t<!-- Add this intent filter below, and change yourapp to your app name -->\n\t<intent-filter>\n\t\t<data android:scheme=\"yourapp\" android:host=\"open\" />\n\t\t<action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" />\n\t</intent-filter>\n</activity>However, you can have many intent-filters. It all depends on how you architecht receiving intents inside your application.Go do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.NOTE This guide assumes that you’re familiar with the Android UI lifecycle. A single Branch object instance is used per Activity or Fragment, so declare an object at the class-level, and you can call this in every Activity or Fragment where you need to interact with Branch; if it has already be initialised elsewhere in your app, the same instance will be returned.Inside your onStart, do the following, where the variable branch is created in your base activity class (of type Branch).@Override\nprotected void onStart() {\n    super.onStart();\n    Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());\n    branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {\n            if (error == null) {\n                // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n                // params will be empty if no data found\n                // ... insert custom logic here ...\n            } else {\n                Log.i(\"MyApp\", error.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n    }, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n}Next, you’ll need to hook into the onNewIntent method specified inside the Activity lifecycle and set the intent. This is required for conformity with Facebook’s AppLinks. Verify that the activity you’re implementing has launchMode set to singleTask inside the Manifest declaration. Once that’d done, go to said activity and do something like the folllowing:@Override\npublic void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {\n    this.setIntent(intent);\n}Side note: This is a requirement because of the new Facebook AppLinks change. Facebook doesn’t open up the browser anymore and just calls the URI to open the app directly. This prevented Branch clicks from being registered. To support it, we pass that link click id through the URI scheme to Branch, and send that back to the app, creating a ‘click’ without actually seeing a click. Android does a very poor job of clearing out intents that were previously called, so this helps ensure that once a URI scheme is called and consumed, it won’t trigger deep linking anymore.branch.initSession(branchReferralInitListener, this.getIntent().getData(), this);NOTE if you’re calling this inside a fragment, please use getActivity() instead of passing in this. Also, this.getIntent().getData() refers to the data associated with an incoming intent.Branch-provided data parameters in callbackPreviously, Branch did not return any information to the app if initSession was called but the user hadn’t clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.\n  ~ denotes analytics\n  + denotes information added by Branch\n  (for the curious, $ denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)\n\n  \n    \n      Parameter\n      Meaning\n    \n    \n      ~channel\n      The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~feature\n      The feature, such as invite or share, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~tags\n      Any tags, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~campaign\n      The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~stage\n      The stage, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~creation_source\n      Where the link was created (‘API’, ‘Dashboard’, ‘SDK’, ‘iOS SDK’, ‘Android SDK’, or ‘Web SDK’)\n    \n    \n      +referrer\n      The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked\n    \n    \n      +phone_number\n      The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app\n    \n    \n      +is_first_session\n      Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)\n    \n    \n      +clicked_branch_link\n      Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session\n    \n  \nAutomatic Session ManagementStarting from Branch SDK version 1.5.7, there is no need for initialising and closing session with the new automatic session management. Automatic session management can work only with API level 14 and above, so make sure that your minSdkVersion is 14 or above.Requirement<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=\"14\" />Once you do any of the below, there is no need to close or init sessions in your Activities. Branch SDK will do all that for you. You can get your Branch instance at any time as follows.Branch branch = Branch.getInstance();Branch SDK can do session management for you if you do one of the following:Common: you do not use Application classIf you are not creating or using an Application class throughout your project, all you need to do is declare BranchApp as your application class in your manifest.<application android:name=\"io.branch.referal.BranchApp\">Rarer: you already use the Application classIf you already have an Application class then extend your application class with BranchApp.public class YourApplication extends BranchAppVery rare: you already use and extend the Application classIf you already have an Application class and don’t want to extend it from BranchApp then create a Branch instance in your Application’s onCreate() method.public void onCreate() {\n    super.onCreate();\n    if (!BuildConfig.DEBUG) {\n        Branch.getInstance(this);\n    } else {\n        Branch.getTestInstance(this);\n    }\n}Close session (session tracking to support for minSdkVersion < 14)Note: There is no need to use this method if you use automatic session management as described above and only support minSdkVersion >= 14Required: Every activity that will use Branch in some way should include Branch SDK methods in both onStart() and onStop(). Don’t forget closeSession() in every activity with Branch!@Override\nprotected void onStop() {\n    super.onStop();\n    branch.closeSession();\n}Handle Deep LinkInside Android, allow us to hook into your activities where you have declared and intent filter for deeplinking. During the onCreate portion of execution, you can add something like the following:branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener() {\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tIterator<?> keys = referringParams.keys();\n\t\t\twhile (keys.hasNext()) {\n\t\t\t\tString key = (String) keys.next();\n\t\t\t\tLog.i(\"Branch Link\", key + \", \" + referringParams.getString(key));\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t// iterate through keys and start an Activity.\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t} catch (JSONException e) {\n\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}, this.getIntent().getData(), this);Routing to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside onStart, when Branch is initialized, you will want to examine the dictionary we pass to you from our callback. This will allow you to know whether or not a link click with context was made. You’ll likely have many entry points based off different parameters.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures, and each picture has an ID. When user A decides to share a picture, attach that ID to the shortUrl or LongURL being created. When User B downloads (or opens the app if they already have it), the call to initSession will inform you of the parameters user A sent. Unpack em, and route away to the right view!@Override\npublic void onStart() {\n    super.onStart();\n\n    Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());\n    branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, Branch.BranchError error) {\n            if (error == null) {\n                // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked before showing up\n                // params will be empty if no data found\n                String pictureID = referringParams.optString(\"picture_id\", \"\");\n                if (pictureID.equals(\"\")) {\n                    startActivity(new Intent(this, HomeActivity.class));\n                }\n                else {\n                    Intent i = new Intent(this, ViewerActivity.class);\n                    i.putExtra(\"picture_id\", pictureID);\n                    startActivity(i);\n                }\n            } else {\n                Log.e(\"MyApp\", error.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n    }, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n    // if you want to specify isReferrable, then comment out the above line and uncomment this line:\n    // }, true, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n}(Optional) Routing: passing information from the BannerNow that you’ve added routing to your app, you can add information to the Smart Banner. If you’ve used the example Smart Banner code above, you simply need to insert any key-value pairs you’d like into the data dictionary.Using our example of routing above with the PicVC, you’d simply need to change the Web Banner code to the following:branch.banner(options, {\n    phone: '9999999999',\n    type: 1,\n    data: {\n        'pictureId': '12345',\n    }\n});Now when a user clicks on the Smart Banner on a mobile device, when they open your app they will be taken straight to a view controller to see picture with id “12345”. It’s that simple.Deep linking has countless possibilities and we’d be happy to brainstorm use cases for your specific app. Happy building!ConclusionYou’ve learned how to add a smart banner to your website with minimal configuration and some copying-and-pasting Javascript into your website. Perhaps the allure of passing data through install or deep linking to content caught your eye and you added the SDK to your Android app. There’s a ton more that Branch can do. For example, you can:\n  \n    Referrals with incentives – reward users based on the installs or engagement they generate\n  \n  \n    Personalized welcome – tailor onboarding for your users\n  \n  \n    See a list of your top influencers whose shared links are driving the most installs\n  \n  \n    Specify the channel (Facebook, Email, etc.) or tag content as it is being shared – then you can see a breakdown of installs by tag on the Dashboard\n  \nQuestions, comments and love letters are always welcome at support@branchmetrics.io."},{"title":"   Deeplinking through Install","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/app_download_banner/android/","body":"This data dictionary containing foo: 'bar' etc is where you put data that you want passed through install.

When User B downloads (or opens the app if they already have it), the call to initSession will inform you of the parameters user A sent.

However, if you’ve already completed Step 1 of our quickstart guide, Integrating the SDK, then you can skip Step 1! Jump to Step 2, The Smart Banner. (You can also skip optional Step 3, Configuring the Client, if you’ve performed this step from the quickstart guide.)\nThe mobile web smart banner is a powerful tool–it brings users in from the web experience where they are more easily lost, to your native mobile experience. On desktop, the banner can even drive users to mobile via our text-me-the-app function.It’s highly customizable. If you want simple, cross-platform download links that just work, follow the first two sections on configuring the dashboard and The Smart Banner.If you also want to pass data through the install process or deep link straight to content, check out the optional 3rd and 4th sections on Configuring the Client for Deep Linking and Routing: passing information from the Banner.Configuring the Dashboard for your iOS appApp NameTo get started, point your browser to https://dashboard.branch.io/. If you haven’t created an account before, you should sign up and complete the basic setup. If you’ve signed up already, navigate to the Summary page and click the dropdown button in the top right. Choose “Create new app.” You will be prompted to enter a name for your new app. Do so and press “Create.”Web URL\n        \n      This is where we will take users who click a Branch link if we don’t know where else to take them. For example, if you don’t have an Android app released yet, Android users will be taken to this link. Don’t forget to Save!To configure the Web URL on an existing app, you will need to navigate to the Settings > Link Settings page on the Dashboard. Scroll down to Default URL and enter your website.   Tip:\nYou can customize this fallback URL on a per-platform or even per-link basis. After completing setup, you may want to check out our section on Custom Redirects.\nApp Store or custom URL\n        \n      Part of the magic of Branch Links is that you can have different configurations for iOS, Android, Fire… – and it just works! In this section, you need to specify where the user can download your app.When setting up an iOS app, you need to locate your app in the App Store. Start typing the name of your app and it should show up in the box.You may be wondering–what if I can’t find my app, or it isn’t on the App Store yet? Good news: you can specify any location you want. For iOS apps, you can put in the URL provided by Apple on iTunesConnect (if you anticipate going live soon) or you can specify a custom URL to wherever the app is hosted remotely.   Note:\nThis field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works).  Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the App Store, it will go to this URL. Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Xcode.\nURI Scheme\n        \n      Note: this is required if you want your smart banner to open the app. If, however, you simply want a banner that links to the App Store (on mobile) or that allows users to text themselves the app (on desktop), you can skip this step.Setting the URI scheme is not strictly required if you are only going to use Branch to measure the number of clicks for a given link. To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For iOS apps, the URI scheme can be specified in the .plist file under URL Types. If you haven’t added one to your iOS app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard.The Smart Banner\n        \n      Branch offers a highly customizable smart banner that works across platforms. Android and iOS users can install or open the app from one banner. Users can even be deep linked to content! Desktop users can choose to text themselves the app.   This just works!\nThis short snippet of code below is enough to add a web banner to both your desktop and mobile web pages! Of course, you’ll want to configure it, so check out both the Smart Banner Options and Link Options below.\nAfter configuring your app on the Dashboard, you can simply add the following code somewhere inside the <head> </head> tags on your website. Note that the only thing you need to do is replace YOUR-BRANCH-KEY with your Branch Key inside the init() call.<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    (function(b,r,a,n,c,h,_,s,d,k){if(!b[n]||!b[n]._q){for(;s<_.length;)c(h,_[s++]);d=r.createElement(a);d.async=1;d.src=\"https://cdn.branch.io/branch-v1.5.6.min.js\";k=r.getElementsByTagName(a)[0];k.parentNode.insertBefore(d,k);b[n]=h}})(window,document,\"script\",\"branch\",function(b,r){b[r]=function(){b._q.push([r,arguments])}},{_q:[],_v:1},\"init data setIdentity logout track link sendSMS referrals credits creditHistory applyCode validateCode getCode redeem banner closeBanner\".split(\" \"),0);\n\nbranch.init('YOUR-BRANCH-KEY');\nbranch.banner({\n    icon: 'http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/wineass/ios7-redesign/512/Appstore-icon.png',\n    title: 'Branch Demo App',\n    description: 'The Branch demo app!'\n}, {});\n\n</script>You can find your Branch Key on the Dashboard’s Settings page.Closing the App Banner ProgrammaticallyThe App Banner includes a close button the user can click, but you may want to close the banner with a timeout, or via some other user interaction with your web app. In this case, closing the banner is very simple by calling Branch.closeBanner().js\nbranch.closeBanner();\nSmart Banner Options, Link OptionsThere are a lot of options here, but don’t be scared. Specifying them is optional, although you’ll probably want to do so to tailor it to your needs.branch.banner({\n    icon: 'http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/wineass/ios7-redesign/512/Appstore-icon.png',\n    title: 'Branch Demo App',\n    description: 'The Branch demo app!',\n    openAppButtonText: 'Open',              // Text to show on button if the user has the app installed\n    downloadAppButtonText: 'Download',      // Text to show on button if the user does not have the app installed\n    sendLinkText: 'Send Link',              // Text to show on desktop button to allow users to text themselves the app\n    phonePreviewText: '+44 9999-9999',      // The default phone placeholder is a US format number, localize the placeholder number with a custom placeholder with this option\n    showiOS: true,                          // Should the banner be shown on iOS devices?\n    showAndroid: true,                      // Should the banner be shown on Android devices?\n    showDesktop: true,                      // Should the banner be shown on desktop devices?\n    iframe: true,                           // Show banner in an iframe, recomended to isolate Branch banner CSS\n    disableHide: false,                     // Should the user have the ability to hide the banner?

This is discussed in the sections on Handle Deep Link and Routing below.\n(Optional) Configuring the Client for Deep LinkingInstalling the SDKFor iOS, the easiest way to install the SDK is via Cocoapods. Add pod \"Branch\" to your podfile and run pod install from the command line.However, if you don’t currently use Cocoapods, you can easily download and install our SDK. To download an open-source copy, grab the zip here.You will need to drag and drop the Branch.framework file that you downloaded into your project. Be sure that “Copy items if needed” is selected.\n        \n      You also need to import CoreTelephony. See the graphic here.   Most accurate matching\nTo get the best experience with Branch, you should import AdSupport.framework. This allows us to leverage the IDFA for more accurate matching, and we can also identify users who return later after uninstalling the app.\nBranch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to YourProject-Info.plist (Info.plist for Swift).\n  In plist file, mouse hover “Information Property List” which is the root item under the Key column.\n  After about half a second, you will see a “+” sign appear. Click it.\n  In the newly added row, fill in “branch_key” for its key, leave type as String, and enter your app key obtained in above steps in its value column.\n  Save the plist file.\nAnimated Gif\n        \n      URI SchemeTo set up your URI Scheme, you’ll need to open your project in XCode and complete the following.\n  Click on YourProject-Info.plist on the left (or in Swift, Info.plist).\n  Find URL Types and click the right arrow. (If it doesn’t exist, right click anywhere and choose Add Row. Scroll down and choose URL Types)\n  Add myapp, where myapp is a unique string for your app, as an item in URL Schemes as below:\nGo do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.The deepLinkHandler is a block of code that executes when a Branch session is successfully initialized, as well as anytime a user clicks a link to your app. This is the central place where you define how your app should respond to links.When a user clicks a Branch link and your app opens, the Branch SDK contacts the Branch servers to see whether this user opening your app is the same one who just clicked the link. If it is, then the params dictionary that you see below will be populated with any data attached to a Branch link if a user just clicked one.The initSession call is an asynchronous call and any other calls will be queued up to complete after the server returns a response.For Swift, you will need to add a bridging header in order to use Branch in your project’s files. For help on adding a bridging header, see this StackOverflow answer.There are a few pieces that must be in place. First, open your project’s AppDelegate.m (or AppDelegate.swift) file.\n  Add #import \"Branch.h\" at the top of the file (Objective-C only)\n  Find the line which reads:\n\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\nobjective-cswiftand paste the following right below it:\n\nBranch *branch = [Branch getInstance];\n[branch initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) {\n        // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n        // params will be empty if no data found\n        // ... insert custom logic here ...\n        NSLog(@\"params: %@\", params.description)\n    }\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   initSession is called 100% of the time\ninitSession is always called, whether or not the user clicked on a Branch link. If no Branch link was clicked, params will come back empty. Plan your application logic accordingly!\nNOTE If you are seeing a “Branch.h file not found” error but you’ve imported the SDK, or it’s breaking during compiling–and you’re using Xcode 6.3 or newer–click here.Branch-provided data parameters in callbackPreviously, Branch did not return any information to the app if initSession was called but the user hadn’t clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.\n  ~ denotes analytics\n  + denotes information added by Branch\n  (for the curious, $ denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)\n\n  \n    \n      Parameter\n      Meaning\n    \n    \n      ~channel\n      The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~feature\n      The feature, such as invite or share, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~tags\n      Any tags, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~campaign\n      The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~stage\n      The stage, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~creation_source\n      Where the link was created (‘API’, ‘Dashboard’, ‘SDK’, ‘iOS SDK’, ‘Android SDK’, or ‘Web SDK’)\n    \n    \n      +referrer\n      The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked\n    \n    \n      +phone_number\n      The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app\n    \n    \n      +is_first_session\n      Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)\n    \n    \n      +clicked_branch_link\n      Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session\n    \n  \nHandle Deep LinkIn order for your app to properly handle deep links, and to allow Branch to work its magic and call the deepLinkHandler, you will need to add the following code within application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation::\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {\n    // pass the url to the handle deep link call\n    if (![[Branch getInstance] handleDeepLink:url]) {\n        // do other deep link routing for the Facebook SDK, Pinterest SDK, etc\n    }\n    return YES;\n}\n\nobjective-cswiftRouting to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside of the deepLinkHandler, you will want to examine the params dictionary to determine whether the user clicked on a link to content. Regardless of whether your app involves pictures, videos, text or whatever novel content your app contains, you likely have an internal system of identifiers.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures and each one is tagged with a picture Id. When a user shares a picture, simply attach a picture Id to the Branch link being created. If a user clicks a link to a specific picture, this Id will show up in the params dictionary in the deepLinkHandler.- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\n  // initialize the session, setup a deep link handler\n  [[Branch getInstance] initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions\n                          andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n\n    // start setting up the view controller hierarchy\n    UINavigationController *navC = (UINavigationController *)self.window.rootViewController;\n    UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"Main\" bundle:nil];\n    UIViewController *nextVC;\n    // If the key 'pictureId' is present in the deep link dictionary\n    // then load the picture screen with the appropriate picture\n    NSString *pictureId = [params objectForKey:@\"pictureId\"];\n    if (pictureId) {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"PicVC\"];\n      [nextVC setNextPictureId:pictureId];\n    } else {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"MainVC\"];\n    }\n    [navC setViewControllers:@[nextVC] animated:YES];\n  }];\n\n  return YES;\n}(Optional) Routing: passing information from the BannerNow that you’ve added routing to your app, you can add information to the Smart Banner. If you’ve used the example Smart Banner code above, you simply need to insert any key-value pairs you’d like into the data dictionary.Using our example of routing above with the PicVC, you’d simply need to change the Web Banner code to the following:branch.banner(options, {\n    phone: '9999999999',\n    type: 1,\n    data: {\n        'pictureId': '12345',\n    }\n});Now when a user clicks on the Smart Banner on a mobile device, when they open your app they will be taken straight to a view controller to see picture with id “12345”. It’s that simple.Deep linking has countless possibilities and we’d be happy to brainstorm use cases for your specific app. Happy building!ConclusionYou’ve learned how to add a smart banner to your website with minimal configuration and some copying-and-pasting Javascript into your website.

This is discussed in the sections on Handle Deep Link and Routing below.\n(Optional) Configuring the Client for Deep LinkingInstalling the SDKFor iOS, the easiest way to install the SDK is via Cocoapods. Add pod \"Branch\" to your podfile and run pod install from the command line.However, if you don’t currently use Cocoapods, you can easily download and install our SDK. To download an open-source copy, grab the zip here.You will need to drag and drop the Branch.framework file that you downloaded into your project. Be sure that “Copy items if needed” is selected.\n        \n      You also need to import CoreTelephony. See the graphic here.   Most accurate matching\nTo get the best experience with Branch, you should import AdSupport.framework. This allows us to leverage the IDFA for more accurate matching, and we can also identify users who return later after uninstalling the app.\nBranch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to YourProject-Info.plist (Info.plist for Swift).\n  In plist file, mouse hover “Information Property List” which is the root item under the Key column.\n  After about half a second, you will see a “+” sign appear. Click it.\n  In the newly added row, fill in “branch_key” for its key, leave type as String, and enter your app key obtained in above steps in its value column.\n  Save the plist file.\nAnimated Gif\n        \n      URI SchemeTo set up your URI Scheme, you’ll need to open your project in XCode and complete the following.\n  Click on YourProject-Info.plist on the left (or in Swift, Info.plist).\n  Find URL Types and click the right arrow. (If it doesn’t exist, right click anywhere and choose Add Row. Scroll down and choose URL Types)\n  Add myapp, where myapp is a unique string for your app, as an item in URL Schemes as below:\nGo do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.The deepLinkHandler is a block of code that executes when a Branch session is successfully initialized, as well as anytime a user clicks a link to your app. This is the central place where you define how your app should respond to links.When a user clicks a Branch link and your app opens, the Branch SDK contacts the Branch servers to see whether this user opening your app is the same one who just clicked the link. If it is, then the params dictionary that you see below will be populated with any data attached to a Branch link if a user just clicked one.The initSession call is an asynchronous call and any other calls will be queued up to complete after the server returns a response.For Swift, you will need to add a bridging header in order to use Branch in your project’s files. For help on adding a bridging header, see this StackOverflow answer.There are a few pieces that must be in place. First, open your project’s AppDelegate.m (or AppDelegate.swift) file.\n  Add #import \"Branch.h\" at the top of the file (Objective-C only)\n  Find the line which reads:\n\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\nobjective-cswiftand paste the following right below it:\n\nBranch *branch = [Branch getInstance];\n[branch initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) {\n        // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n        // params will be empty if no data found\n        // ... insert custom logic here ...\n        NSLog(@\"params: %@\", params.description)\n    }\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   initSession is called 100% of the time\ninitSession is always called, whether or not the user clicked on a Branch link. If no Branch link was clicked, params will come back empty. Plan your application logic accordingly!\nNOTE If you are seeing a “Branch.h file not found” error but you’ve imported the SDK, or it’s breaking during compiling–and you’re using Xcode 6.3 or newer–click here.Branch-provided data parameters in callbackPreviously, Branch did not return any information to the app if initSession was called but the user hadn’t clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.\n  ~ denotes analytics\n  + denotes information added by Branch\n  (for the curious, $ denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)\n\n  \n    \n      Parameter\n      Meaning\n    \n    \n      ~channel\n      The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~feature\n      The feature, such as invite or share, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~tags\n      Any tags, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~campaign\n      The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~stage\n      The stage, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~creation_source\n      Where the link was created (‘API’, ‘Dashboard’, ‘SDK’, ‘iOS SDK’, ‘Android SDK’, or ‘Web SDK’)\n    \n    \n      +referrer\n      The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked\n    \n    \n      +phone_number\n      The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app\n    \n    \n      +is_first_session\n      Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)\n    \n    \n      +clicked_branch_link\n      Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session\n    \n  \nHandle Deep LinkIn order for your app to properly handle deep links, and to allow Branch to work its magic and call the deepLinkHandler, you will need to add the following code within application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation::\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {\n    // pass the url to the handle deep link call\n    if (![[Branch getInstance] handleDeepLink:url]) {\n        // do other deep link routing for the Facebook SDK, Pinterest SDK, etc\n    }\n    return YES;\n}\n\nobjective-cswiftRouting to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside of the deepLinkHandler, you will want to examine the params dictionary to determine whether the user clicked on a link to content. Regardless of whether your app involves pictures, videos, text or whatever novel content your app contains, you likely have an internal system of identifiers.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures and each one is tagged with a picture Id. When a user shares a picture, simply attach a picture Id to the Branch link being created. If a user clicks a link to a specific picture, this Id will show up in the params dictionary in the deepLinkHandler.- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\n  // initialize the session, setup a deep link handler\n  [[Branch getInstance] initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions\n                          andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n\n    // start setting up the view controller hierarchy\n    UINavigationController *navC = (UINavigationController *)self.window.rootViewController;\n    UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"Main\" bundle:nil];\n    UIViewController *nextVC;\n    // If the key 'pictureId' is present in the deep link dictionary\n    // then load the picture screen with the appropriate picture\n    NSString *pictureId = [params objectForKey:@\"pictureId\"];\n    if (pictureId) {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"PicVC\"];\n      [nextVC setNextPictureId:pictureId];\n    } else {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"MainVC\"];\n    }\n    [navC setViewControllers:@[nextVC] animated:YES];\n  }];\n\n  return YES;\n}(Optional) Routing: passing information from the BannerNow that you’ve added routing to your app, you can add information to the Smart Banner. If you’ve used the example Smart Banner code above, you simply need to insert any key-value pairs you’d like into the data dictionary.Using our example of routing above with the PicVC, you’d simply need to change the Web Banner code to the following:branch.banner(options, {\n    phone: '9999999999',\n    type: 1,\n    data: {\n        'pictureId': '12345',\n    }\n});Now when a user clicks on the Smart Banner on a mobile device, when they open your app they will be taken straight to a view controller to see picture with id “12345”. It’s that simple.Deep linking has countless possibilities and we’d be happy to brainstorm use cases for your specific app. Happy building!ConclusionYou’ve learned how to add a smart banner to your website with minimal configuration and some copying-and-pasting Javascript into your website. Perhaps the allure of passing data through install or deep linking to content caught your eye and you added the SDK to your iOS app. There’s a ton more that Branch can do. For example, you can:\n  \n    Referrals with incentives – reward users based on the installs or engagement they generate\n  \n  \n    Personalized welcome – tailor onboarding for your users\n  \n  \n    See a list of your top influencers whose shared links are driving the most installs\n  \n  \n    Specify the channel (Facebook, Email, etc.) or tag content as it is being shared – then you can see a breakdown of installs by tag on the Dashboard\n  \nQuestions, comments and love letters are always welcome at support@branchmetrics.io."},{"title":"   Tip:","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/app_download_banner/ios/","body":"You can customize this fallback URL on a per-platform or even per-link basis. After completing setup, you may want to check out our section on Custom Redirects."},{"title":"App Store or custom URL","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/app_download_banner/ios/#app-store-or-custom-url","body":"\n        \n      Part of the magic of Branch Links is that you can have different configurations for iOS, Android, Fire… – and it just works! In this section, you need to specify where the user can download your app.When setting up an iOS app, you need to locate your app in the App Store. Start typing the name of your app and it should show up in the box.You may be wondering–what if I can’t find my app, or it isn’t on the App Store yet? Good news: you can specify any location you want. For iOS apps, you can put in the URL provided by Apple on iTunesConnect (if you anticipate going live soon) or you can specify a custom URL to wherever the app is hosted remotely.   Note:\nThis field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works).  Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the App Store, it will go to this URL. Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Xcode.\nURI Scheme\n        \n      Note: this is required if you want your smart banner to open the app. If, however, you simply want a banner that links to the App Store (on mobile) or that allows users to text themselves the app (on desktop), you can skip this step.Setting the URI scheme is not strictly required if you are only going to use Branch to measure the number of clicks for a given link. To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For iOS apps, the URI scheme can be specified in the .plist file under URL Types. If you haven’t added one to your iOS app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard.The Smart Banner\n        \n      Branch offers a highly customizable smart banner that works across platforms. Android and iOS users can install or open the app from one banner. Users can even be deep linked to content! Desktop users can choose to text themselves the app.   This just works!\nThis short snippet of code below is enough to add a web banner to both your desktop and mobile web pages!

Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.\n  ~ denotes analytics\n  + denotes information added by Branch\n  (for the curious, $ denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)\n\n  \n    \n      Parameter\n      Meaning\n    \n    \n      ~channel\n      The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~feature\n      The feature, such as invite or share, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~tags\n      Any tags, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~campaign\n      The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~stage\n      The stage, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~creation_source\n      Where the link was created (‘API’, ‘Dashboard’, ‘SDK’, ‘iOS SDK’, ‘Android SDK’, or ‘Web SDK’)\n    \n    \n      +referrer\n      The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked\n    \n    \n      +phone_number\n      The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app\n    \n    \n      +is_first_session\n      Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)\n    \n    \n      +clicked_branch_link\n      Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session\n    \n  \nHandle Deep LinkIn order for your app to properly handle deep links, and to allow Branch to work its magic and call the deepLinkHandler, you will need to add the following code within application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation::\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {\n    // pass the url to the handle deep link call\n    if (![[Branch getInstance] handleDeepLink:url]) {\n        // do other deep link routing for the Facebook SDK, Pinterest SDK, etc\n    }\n    return YES;\n}\n\nobjective-cswiftRouting to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside of the deepLinkHandler, you will want to examine the params dictionary to determine whether the user clicked on a link to content. Regardless of whether your app involves pictures, videos, text or whatever novel content your app contains, you likely have an internal system of identifiers.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures and each one is tagged with a picture Id. When a user shares a picture, simply attach a picture Id to the Branch link being created. If a user clicks a link to a specific picture, this Id will show up in the params dictionary in the deepLinkHandler.- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\n  // initialize the session, setup a deep link handler\n  [[Branch getInstance] initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions\n                          andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n\n    // start setting up the view controller hierarchy\n    UINavigationController *navC = (UINavigationController *)self.window.rootViewController;\n    UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"Main\" bundle:nil];\n    UIViewController *nextVC;\n    // If the key 'pictureId' is present in the deep link dictionary\n    // then load the picture screen with the appropriate picture\n    NSString *pictureId = [params objectForKey:@\"pictureId\"];\n    if (pictureId) {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"PicVC\"];\n      [nextVC setNextPictureId:pictureId];\n    } else {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"MainVC\"];\n    }\n    [navC setViewControllers:@[nextVC] animated:YES];\n  }];\n\n  return YES;\n}(Optional) Routing: passing information from the BannerNow that you’ve added routing to your app, you can add information to the Smart Banner. If you’ve used the example Smart Banner code above, you simply need to insert any key-value pairs you’d like into the data dictionary.Using our example of routing above with the PicVC, you’d simply need to change the Web Banner code to the following:branch.banner(options, {\n    phone: '9999999999',\n    type: 1,\n    data: {\n        'pictureId': '12345',\n    }\n});Now when a user clicks on the Smart Banner on a mobile device, when they open your app they will be taken straight to a view controller to see picture with id “12345”. It’s that simple.Deep linking has countless possibilities and we’d be happy to brainstorm use cases for your specific app. Happy building!ConclusionYou’ve learned how to add a smart banner to your website with minimal configuration and some copying-and-pasting Javascript into your website. Perhaps the allure of passing data through install or deep linking to content caught your eye and you added the SDK to your iOS app. There’s a ton more that Branch can do. For example, you can:\n  \n    Referrals with incentives – reward users based on the installs or engagement they generate\n  \n  \n    Personalized welcome – tailor onboarding for your users\n  \n  \n    See a list of your top influencers whose shared links are driving the most installs\n  \n  \n    Specify the channel (Facebook, Email, etc.) or tag content as it is being shared – then you can see a breakdown of installs by tag on the Dashboard\n  \nQuestions, comments and love letters are always welcome at support@branchmetrics.io."},{"title":"   Note:","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/app_download_banner/ios/","body":"This field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works).  Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the App Store, it will go to this URL. Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Xcode."},{"title":"URI Scheme","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/app_download_banner/ios/#uri-scheme","body":"\n        \n      Note: this is required if you want your smart banner to open the app. If, however, you simply want a banner that links to the App Store (on mobile) or that allows users to text themselves the app (on desktop), you can skip this step.Setting the URI scheme is not strictly required if you are only going to use Branch to measure the number of clicks for a given link. To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For iOS apps, the URI scheme can be specified in the .plist file under URL Types. If you haven’t added one to your iOS app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard."},{"title":"The Smart Banner","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/app_download_banner/ios/#the-smart-banner","body":"\n        \n      Branch offers a highly customizable smart banner that works across platforms. Android and iOS users can install or open the app from one banner. Users can even be deep linked to content! Desktop users can choose to text themselves the app.   This just works!\nThis short snippet of code below is enough to add a web banner to both your desktop and mobile web pages! Of course, you’ll want to configure it, so check out both the Smart Banner Options and Link Options below.\nAfter configuring your app on the Dashboard, you can simply add the following code somewhere inside the <head> </head> tags on your website. Note that the only thing you need to do is replace YOUR-BRANCH-KEY with your Branch Key inside the init() call.<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    (function(b,r,a,n,c,h,_,s,d,k){if(!b[n]||!b[n]._q){for(;s<_.length;)c(h,_[s++]);d=r.createElement(a);d.async=1;d.src=\"https://cdn.branch.io/branch-v1.5.6.min.js\";k=r.getElementsByTagName(a)[0];k.parentNode.insertBefore(d,k);b[n]=h}})(window,document,\"script\",\"branch\",function(b,r){b[r]=function(){b._q.push([r,arguments])}},{_q:[],_v:1},\"init data setIdentity logout track link sendSMS referrals credits creditHistory applyCode validateCode getCode redeem banner closeBanner\".split(\" \"),0);\n\nbranch.init('YOUR-BRANCH-KEY');\nbranch.banner({\n    icon: 'http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/wineass/ios7-redesign/512/Appstore-icon.png',\n    title: 'Branch Demo App',\n    description: 'The Branch demo app!'\n}, {});\n\n</script>You can find your Branch Key on the Dashboard’s Settings page.Closing the App Banner ProgrammaticallyThe App Banner includes a close button the user can click, but you may want to close the banner with a timeout, or via some other user interaction with your web app. In this case, closing the banner is very simple by calling Branch.closeBanner().js\nbranch.closeBanner();\nSmart Banner Options, Link OptionsThere are a lot of options here, but don’t be scared. Specifying them is optional, although you’ll probably want to do so to tailor it to your needs.branch.banner({\n    icon: 'http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/wineass/ios7-redesign/512/Appstore-icon.png',\n    title: 'Branch Demo App',\n    description: 'The Branch demo app!',\n    openAppButtonText: 'Open',              // Text to show on button if the user has the app installed\n    downloadAppButtonText: 'Download',      // Text to show on button if the user does not have the app installed\n    sendLinkText: 'Send Link',              // Text to show on desktop button to allow users to text themselves the app\n    phonePreviewText: '+44 9999-9999',      // The default phone placeholder is a US format number, localize the placeholder number with a custom placeholder with this option\n    showiOS: true,                          // Should the banner be shown on iOS devices?\n    showAndroid: true,                      // Should the banner be shown on Android devices?\n    showDesktop: true,                      // Should the banner be shown on desktop devices?\n    iframe: true,                           // Show banner in an iframe, recomended to isolate Branch banner CSS\n    disableHide: false,                     // Should the user have the ability to hide the banner?

This is discussed in the sections on Handle Deep Link and Routing below.\n(Optional) Configuring the Client for Deep LinkingInstalling the SDKFor iOS, the easiest way to install the SDK is via Cocoapods. Add pod \"Branch\" to your podfile and run pod install from the command line.However, if you don’t currently use Cocoapods, you can easily download and install our SDK. To download an open-source copy, grab the zip here.You will need to drag and drop the Branch.framework file that you downloaded into your project. Be sure that “Copy items if needed” is selected.\n        \n      You also need to import CoreTelephony. See the graphic here.   Most accurate matching\nTo get the best experience with Branch, you should import AdSupport.framework. This allows us to leverage the IDFA for more accurate matching, and we can also identify users who return later after uninstalling the app.\nBranch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to YourProject-Info.plist (Info.plist for Swift).\n  In plist file, mouse hover “Information Property List” which is the root item under the Key column.\n  After about half a second, you will see a “+” sign appear. Click it.\n  In the newly added row, fill in “branch_key” for its key, leave type as String, and enter your app key obtained in above steps in its value column.\n  Save the plist file.\nAnimated Gif\n        \n      URI SchemeTo set up your URI Scheme, you’ll need to open your project in XCode and complete the following.\n  Click on YourProject-Info.plist on the left (or in Swift, Info.plist).\n  Find URL Types and click the right arrow. (If it doesn’t exist, right click anywhere and choose Add Row. Scroll down and choose URL Types)\n  Add myapp, where myapp is a unique string for your app, as an item in URL Schemes as below:\nGo do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.The deepLinkHandler is a block of code that executes when a Branch session is successfully initialized, as well as anytime a user clicks a link to your app. This is the central place where you define how your app should respond to links.When a user clicks a Branch link and your app opens, the Branch SDK contacts the Branch servers to see whether this user opening your app is the same one who just clicked the link. If it is, then the params dictionary that you see below will be populated with any data attached to a Branch link if a user just clicked one.The initSession call is an asynchronous call and any other calls will be queued up to complete after the server returns a response.For Swift, you will need to add a bridging header in order to use Branch in your project’s files. For help on adding a bridging header, see this StackOverflow answer.There are a few pieces that must be in place. First, open your project’s AppDelegate.m (or AppDelegate.swift) file.\n  Add #import \"Branch.h\" at the top of the file (Objective-C only)\n  Find the line which reads:\n\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\nobjective-cswiftand paste the following right below it:\n\nBranch *branch = [Branch getInstance];\n[branch initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) {\n        // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n        // params will be empty if no data found\n        // ... insert custom logic here ...\n        NSLog(@\"params: %@\", params.description)\n    }\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   initSession is called 100% of the time\ninitSession is always called, whether or not the user clicked on a Branch link. If no Branch link was clicked, params will come back empty.

There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.The deepLinkHandler is a block of code that executes when a Branch session is successfully initialized, as well as anytime a user clicks a link to your app. This is the central place where you define how your app should respond to links.When a user clicks a Branch link and your app opens, the Branch SDK contacts the Branch servers to see whether this user opening your app is the same one who just clicked the link. If it is, then the params dictionary that you see below will be populated with any data attached to a Branch link if a user just clicked one.The initSession call is an asynchronous call and any other calls will be queued up to complete after the server returns a response.For Swift, you will need to add a bridging header in order to use Branch in your project’s files. For help on adding a bridging header, see this StackOverflow answer.There are a few pieces that must be in place.

That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside of the deepLinkHandler, you will want to examine the params dictionary to determine whether the user clicked on a link to content. Regardless of whether your app involves pictures, videos, text or whatever novel content your app contains, you likely have an internal system of identifiers.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures and each one is tagged with a picture Id. When a user shares a picture, simply attach a picture Id to the Branch link being created. If a user clicks a link to a specific picture, this Id will show up in the params dictionary in the deepLinkHandler.- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\n  // initialize the session, setup a deep link handler\n  [[Branch getInstance] initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions\n                          andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n\n    // start setting up the view controller hierarchy\n    UINavigationController *navC = (UINavigationController *)self.window.rootViewController;\n    UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"Main\" bundle:nil];\n    UIViewController *nextVC;\n    // If the key 'pictureId' is present in the deep link dictionary\n    // then load the picture screen with the appropriate picture\n    NSString *pictureId = [params objectForKey:@\"pictureId\"];\n    if (pictureId) {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"PicVC\"];\n      [nextVC setNextPictureId:pictureId];\n    } else {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"MainVC\"];\n    }\n    [navC setViewControllers:@[nextVC] animated:YES];\n  }];\n\n  return YES;\n}(Optional) Routing: passing information from the BannerNow that you’ve added routing to your app, you can add information to the Smart Banner. If you’ve used the example Smart Banner code above, you simply need to insert any key-value pairs you’d like into the data dictionary.Using our example of routing above with the PicVC, you’d simply need to change the Web Banner code to the following:branch.banner(options, {\n    phone: '9999999999',\n    type: 1,\n    data: {\n        'pictureId': '12345',\n    }\n});Now when a user clicks on the Smart Banner on a mobile device, when they open your app they will be taken straight to a view controller to see picture with id “12345”.

If you haven’t completed those steps, please do so now.\nIf you’ve completed optional Steps 3 & 4 of our quickstart guide, then you already know how to share content and deeplink straight to it. This guide can serve as a refresher.Creating links programmatically to share contentLinks are the foundation to everything Branch offers. Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. With Branch links, you can tell whether a user installed your app thanks to a Facebook ad, an email campaign or a personal invite from a friend.On the world wide web, URLs allow users to go straight to content rather than wading through an entire site. You can send your friend a link to a specific radio station – http://www.iheart.com/live/wild-949-305/ – and other users will be taken straight to that station. Branch links work the same way. The link https://bnc.lt/l/3mN6Lak-2u will open the Wild 94.9 station even if you didn’t have the app installed previously.Here’s how to create your own Branch Links.On iOS, it’s a rather simple method call.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   Data is for Deeplinking\nYou use the data to link directly to content!

We highly recommend showing the user a spinner and disabling your “share” button while the link is being generated. You can either use UIActivityIndicatorView (native) or an external library like MBProgressHUD.At the top of your view controller’s implementation (.m) file, include the following:\n\n#import <MessageUI/MessageUI.h>\n#import <MessageUI/MFMailComposeViewController.h>\n\nobjective-cswiftThen be sure to indicate that your view controller conforms to MFMessageComposeViewControllerDelegate protocol. This is done by modifying the @interface line of your view controller’s implementation (.m) file.\n\n@interface MyAppViewController () <MFMessageComposeViewControllerDelegate>\n\nobjective-cswiftThe following code should go in some method triggered by the user (such as when the user taps on a button).\n\nNSDictionary *params = @{@\"referringUsername\": @\"Bob\",\n                         @\"referringUserId\": @\"1234\"};\n// ... insert code to start the spinner of your choice here ...\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:params\n                                 andChannel:@\"SMS\"\n                                 andFeature:@\"Referral\"\n                                andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) {\n        // Check to make sure we can send messages on this device\n        if ([MFMessageComposeViewController canSendText]) {\n            MFMessageComposeViewController *messageComposer =\n                [[MFMessageComposeViewController alloc] init];\n            // Set the contents of the SMS/iMessage -- be sure to include the URL!\n            [messageComposer setBody:[NSString stringWithFormat:\n                @\"Check out MyApp -- use my link to get free  points: %@\", url]];\n            messageComposer.messageComposeDelegate = self;\n            [self presentViewController:messageComposer animated:YES completion:^{\n                // ... insert code to stop the spinner here\n            }];\n        } else {\n            // ... insert code to stop the spinner here\n            [[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"Sorry\"\n                                        message:@\"Your device cannot send messages.\"\n                                       delegate:nil\n                              cancelButtonTitle:@\"Okay\"\n                              otherButtonTitles:nil] show];\n        }\n    }\n}];\n\nobjective-cswiftLastly, there is a required delegate method for the MessageComposeViewController. We provide an empty implementation, which you are free to customize.\n\n- (void)messageComposeViewController:(MFMessageComposeViewController *)controller\n                 didFinishWithResult:(MessageComposeResult)result {\n    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];\n}\n\nobjective-cswiftThe above code allows you to quickly implement sharing via SMS.

Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. With Branch links, you can tell whether a user installed your app thanks to a Facebook ad, an email campaign or a personal invite from a friend.On the world wide web, URLs allow users to go straight to content rather than wading through an entire site.

Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. With Branch links, you can tell whether a user installed your app thanks to a Facebook ad, an email campaign or a personal invite from a friend.On the world wide web, URLs allow users to go straight to content rather than wading through an entire site. You can send your friend a link to a specific radio station – http://www.iheart.com/live/wild-949-305/ – and other users will be taken straight to that station. Branch links work the same way. The link https://bnc.lt/l/3mN6Lak-2u will open the Wild 94.9 station even if you didn’t have the app installed previously.Here’s how to create your own Branch Links.On iOS, it’s a rather simple method call.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   Data is for Deeplinking\nYou use the data to link directly to content!

Keep reading…\nRouting to content within your iOS appRouting to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside of the deepLinkHandler, you will want to examine the params dictionary to determine whether the user clicked on a link to content. Regardless of whether your app involves pictures, videos, text or whatever novel content your app contains, you likely have an internal system of identifiers.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures and each one is tagged with a picture Id. When a user shares a picture, simply attach a picture Id to the Branch link being created. If a user clicks a link to a specific picture, this Id will show up in the params dictionary in the deepLinkHandler.- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\n  // initialize the session, setup a deep link handler\n  [[Branch getInstance] initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions\n                          andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n\n    // start setting up the view controller hierarchy\n    UINavigationController *navC = (UINavigationController *)self.window.rootViewController;\n    UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"Main\" bundle:nil];\n    UIViewController *nextVC;\n    // If the key 'pictureId' is present in the deep link dictionary\n    // then load the picture screen with the appropriate picture\n    NSString *pictureId = [params objectForKey:@\"pictureId\"];\n    if (pictureId) {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"PicVC\"];\n      [nextVC setNextPictureId:pictureId];\n    } else {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"MainVC\"];\n    }\n    [navC setViewControllers:@[nextVC] animated:YES];\n  }];\n\n  return YES;\n}Sharing Methods (Optional)Sharing via SMSTo quickly share via SMS/iMessage, we’ve included some code that you can copy and paste into your own app. This is all the code you need to get users started on inviting other users!First, note that this is making an asynchronous call to Branch’s servers to generate the link and attach the information provided in the params dictionary.

This is best for situations where end users will not see the link and where creating the link via the HTTP API would be needlessly complicated. This is covered in our first section, Structuring a ‘dynamic’ Deeplink.In every other situation we recommend using the public HTTP API or one of our client SDKs. The HTTP API is covered in the second section and includes an example that you can run from the command line.   Bulk Link Creation\nWe also offer the ability to create links in bulk. Click here to see the HTTP API endpoint. However, in general it is a good idea to use one of the two methods described below–a one-time investment in a flexible system is much better than bulk creating and distributing links on many separate occasions.\nStructuring a ‘dynamic’ DeeplinkAgain, this should be used for situations where the longer link is okay and you want to create links quickly without a POST to the API.EndpointGET https://bnc.lt/a/<branch_key>?AnyOptionalQueryParamsBelow\nExample:\nhttps://bnc.lt/a/key_live_jbgnjxvlhSb6PGH23BhO4hiflcp3y7ky?data=ExampleBase64EncodedString&has_app=no&channel=facebook&stage=level4&feature=affiliate\nParameters\n  branch_key required\n  The Branch key of the originating app\nFunctionaldata  optional : Default is { }.

The appearance in social media can be customized with the $og_title, $og_description and $og_image_url keys.has_app optional : Default is ‘no’. Possible values are ‘yes’ or ‘no’. If you specify ‘yes’, we’ll try to open up the app immediately instead of sending the clicker to the app store.duration optional : ADVANCED: In seconds. Only set this key if you want to override the match duration for deep link matching. This is the time that Branch allows a click to remain outstanding and be eligible to be matched with a new app session. This is default set to 7200 (2 hours)type optional : ADVANCED: Default is 0. Possible values are 0 or 1. A type of 0 means that the link will pass parameters through install any time that it is clicked and followed by an app session. A type of 1 is a security measure, which prevents the link from passing parameters into the app after the first successful deep link.Trackingtags optional (each max 64 characters) : An array of strings, which are custom tags in which to categorize the links by. Recommended syntax: ?tags=a&tags=b&tags=ccampaign optional (max 128 characters) : The campaign in which the link will be used. eg: “new_product_launch”, etc.feature optional (max 128 characters) : The feature in which the link will be used. eg: “invite”, “referral”, “share”, “gift”, etc.channel optional (max 128 characters) : The channel in which the link will be shared. eg: “facebook”, “text_message”.stage optional (max 128 characters) : A string value that represents the stage of the user in the app. eg: “level1”, “logged_in”, etc.Creating a Deep Linking URL via the HTTP APIThe HTTP API allows you to make a POST request and get back a short URL.

For example, you could specify “$deeplink_path”: “radio/station/456” and we’ll open the app with the URI “yourapp://radio/station/456?link_click_id=branch-identifier”. This is primarily for supporting legacy deep linking infrastructure.\n    \n    \n      “$always_deeplink”\n      true or false. (default is not to deep link first) This key can be specified to have our linking service force try to open the app, even if we’re not sure the user has the app installed. If the app is not installed, we fall back to the respective app store or $platform_url key. By default, we only open the app if we’ve seen a user initiate a session in your app from a Branch link (has been cookied and deep linked by Branch).\n    \n  \nalias optional (max 128 characters) : Instead of our standard encoded short url, you can specify the alias of the link bnc.lt/alexaustin. Aliases are enforced to be unique per domain (bnc.lt, yourapp.com, etc). Be careful, link aliases are unique, immutable objects that cannot be deleted.   Aliased links are cached\nNOTE: If you POST to the this endpoint with the same alias, and a matching set of other POST parameters to an existing aliased link, the original will be returned to you. If it clashes and you don’t specify a match, will return a HTTP 409 error.\ntype optional : ADVANCED: Set type to 1, to make the URL a one-time use URL. It won’t deep link after 1 successful deep link.duration optional : ADVANCED: In seconds. Only set this key if you want to override the match duration for deep link matching. This is the time that Branch allows a click to remain outstanding and be eligible to be matched with a new app session. This is default set to 7200 (2 hours)Trackingidentity  optional (max 127 characters) : The identity used to identify the user. If the link is not tied to an identity, there’s no need to specify an identity.tags optional (each max 64 characters) : An array of strings, which are custom tags in which to categorize the links by. Recommended syntax: “tags”:[t1,t2,t3].campaign optional (max 128 characters) : The campaign in which the link will be used. eg: “new_product_launch”, etc.feature optional (max 128 characters) : The feature in which the link will be used. eg: “invite”, “referral”, “share”, “gift”, etc.channel optional (max 128 characters) : The channel in which the link will be shared. eg: “facebook”, “text_message”.stage optional (max 128 characters) : A string value that represents the stage of the user in the app. eg: “level1”, “logged_in”, etc.Returns{\n    'url': 'http://bnc.lt/l/deeplink-randomID'\n}\nConclusionWe covered two methods of dynamically creating links.

Aliased links are cached\nNOTE: If you POST to the this endpoint with the same alias, and a matching set of other POST parameters to an existing aliased link, the original will be returned to you.

It won’t deep link after 1 successful deep link.duration optional : ADVANCED: In seconds. Only set this key if you want to override the match duration for deep link matching. This is the time that Branch allows a click to remain outstanding and be eligible to be matched with a new app session.

If the link is not tied to an identity, there’s no need to specify an identity.tags optional (each max 64 characters) : An array of strings, which are custom tags in which to categorize the links by.

This is where we grab a fingerprint snapshot of a user in the browser before redirecting them to the appropriate app store. When that user installs the app, we send a new fingerprint snapshot from our native library to be matched to the browser fingerprint. We are often asked about the accuracy of this technique, so we’ve written this section to help –\n  “How accurate is Branch?”\n  “Can I trust Branch enough to base rewards on it?”\n  “Do you ever mess up?”\nAnd most importantly…\n  “What control do I have over Branch’s matching algorithms?”\nThe following addresses all of these questions."},{"title":"How does Branch matching work?","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/matching_accuracy/#how-does-branch-matching-work","body":"There are three mechanisms by which we pass data through to the app and attribute app sessions back to the source:1) Direct deep linkingIf the app is currently installed on the phone, and you’ve configured your Branch links with your app’s URI scheme (myapp://), we will open the app immediately and pass a click identifier through to our native library. This click identifier is then sent to the Branch servers to retrieve the dictionary of data associated with the link.For example, we’d call myapp://open?link_click_id=123456 to open the app immediately. The Branch native library parses out link_click_id: 123456 and passes it back to the Branch API to retrieve the link associated with that link click.2) 100% match browser-app profile hitBecause we set a first party browser cookie on the bnc.lt (Branchlet) domain for any app that uses a Branch link which is deterministically matched up to the hardware id or IDFA retrieved via our native library on every link click, we can use this historical data to guarantee 100% accuracy on repeat users. So, when a user clicks a Branch link for your app, and we’ve seen them click a link for another app on our network, we’ve already matched them up to a corresponding app identifier. This means that when they install the app, we know with 100% certainty that they just came from that link click.The fact that we have such a global network of apps with hundreds of millions of users clicking links, means that when you join the platform, you can benefit from the crowd-sourced accuracy gained through all our apps contributing the browser-app profiles.3) Browser to app fingerprint matchBranch collects information about devices both when a user is in the browser – via a click on a Branch link – and then after they open the app. This information includes IP Address, OS, OS version, device model, screen size and other parameters. This is the user’s digital fingerprint and can be obtained in the browser and in the app.We match the unqiue fingerprint collected in the app to the unique fingerprint collected in the browser to determine where user originated from if the prior two mechanisms were not used.Believe us, this very, very accurate."},{"title":"The nuances and edge cases","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/matching_accuracy/#the-nuances-and-edge-cases","body":"It’s technically possible that users can click the link at the same time and have identical fingerprints. Same IP address, identical devices, identical software versions and never before seen by Branch. It’s very rare out in the wild. For this reason, if someone clicks a link but doesn’t open the app, we “expire” their browser-based digital fingerprint after two hours by default. However, this duration is completely tunable by you.A note about potential mismatch: This is an extremely rare case. So much so that the benefit to you from analytics perspective and the user from a personalization and delight perspective greatly outweigh the rareity of a mismatch. We only make you aware if it in order to design your new user experiences to be tolerant."},{"title":"Match Type","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/matching_accuracy/#match-type","body":"If you are super concerned that users may potentially have the same fingerprint, you can choose to have us not match users if two identical fingerprints are outstanding. On the Dashboard’s Link Settings page, under advanced options, you should set Match Type.This means that if two users with the same fingerprint, on the same wifi, were to click the link, we would blacklist that digital fingerprint for the expiration duration. Therefore, when they open up the app, no match would be made.\n        \n      "},{"title":"Duration","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/matching_accuracy/#duration","body":"You can also modify the 2 hour default expiration for browser-based digital fingerprints.

If you haven’t completed those steps, please do so now.\nRight now, when users open your app for the first time, chances are you have no idea where they came from or who they are. You have no idea if they were invited by a friend on Facebook, found your app randomly browsing through the App Store, saw an ad, or simply discovered it through word of mouth and decided to give it a shot. It’s anybody’s guess really.You can’t tailor the onboarding flow for new users–it’s the same first few steps for everyone.With Branch you can know:\n  if a friend invited this user via a link shared on social media, in an email, or via SMS.\n  which of the above channels–social media, email, text, etc.–they came from!\n  what link their friend shared that brought them to the app in the first place–was it a general link, a “skip-the-waitlist” link, or a “check-out-my-awesome-profile” link.\n  show a custom message to the new user–“Welcome, from your friend John and the whole MyApp team!”\n  reward either or both users for the referred install and any other custom events.\nBranch does all of this through simple means, allowing you to attach any data you want to any link. That data then pops up in your app when a user clicks a Branch link.What you do with this data is up to you, but of course we’re here to help with tailored analytics around clicks, installs, opens and engagement.Let’s get started!Generating LinksCreating LinksLinks are the foundation to everything Branch offers.

Good news: you can specify any location you want. For iOS apps, you can put in the URL provided by Apple on iTunesConnect (if you anticipate going live soon) or you can specify a custom URL to wherever the app is hosted remotely.   Note:\nThis field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works).  Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the App Store, it will go to this URL. Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Xcode.\nURI Scheme\n        \n      Setting the URI scheme is not strictly required if you are only going to use Branch to measure the number of clicks for a given link. To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For iOS apps, the URI scheme can be specified in the .plist file under URL Types. If you haven’t added one to your iOS app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard.Configuring your iOS appInstalling the SDKFor iOS, the easiest way to install the SDK is via Cocoapods. Add pod \"Branch\" to your podfile and run pod install from the command line.However, if you don’t currently use Cocoapods, you can easily download and install our SDK. To download an open-source copy, grab the zip here.You will need to drag and drop the Branch.framework file that you downloaded into your project. Be sure that “Copy items if needed” is selected.\n        \n      You also need to import CoreTelephony. See the graphic here.   Most accurate matching\nTo get the best experience with Branch, you should import AdSupport.framework. This allows us to leverage the IDFA for more accurate matching, and we can also identify users who return later after uninstalling the app.\nBranch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to YourProject-Info.plist (Info.plist for Swift).\n  In plist file, mouse hover “Information Property List” which is the root item under the Key column.\n  After about half a second, you will see a “+” sign appear. Click it.\n  In the newly added row, fill in “branch_key” for its key, leave type as String, and enter your app key obtained in above steps in its value column.\n  Save the plist file.\nAnimated Gif\n        \n      URI SchemeTo set up your URI Scheme, you’ll need to open your project in XCode and complete the following.\n  Click on YourProject-Info.plist on the left (or in Swift, Info.plist).\n  Find URL Types and click the right arrow. (If it doesn’t exist, right click anywhere and choose Add Row. Scroll down and choose URL Types)\n  Add myapp, where myapp is a unique string for your app, as an item in URL Schemes as below:\nGo do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.The deepLinkHandler is a block of code that executes when a Branch session is successfully initialized, as well as anytime a user clicks a link to your app. This is the central place where you define how your app should respond to links.When a user clicks a Branch link and your app opens, the Branch SDK contacts the Branch servers to see whether this user opening your app is the same one who just clicked the link. If it is, then the params dictionary that you see below will be populated with any data attached to a Branch link if a user just clicked one.The initSession call is an asynchronous call and any other calls will be queued up to complete after the server returns a response.For Swift, you will need to add a bridging header in order to use Branch in your project’s files. For help on adding a bridging header, see this StackOverflow answer.There are a few pieces that must be in place. First, open your project’s AppDelegate.m (or AppDelegate.swift) file.\n  Add #import \"Branch.h\" at the top of the file (Objective-C only)\n  Find the line which reads:\n\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\nobjective-cswiftand paste the following right below it:\n\nBranch *branch = [Branch getInstance];\n[branch initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) {\n        // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n        // params will be empty if no data found\n        // ... insert custom logic here ...\n        NSLog(@\"params: %@\", params.description)\n    }\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   initSession is called 100% of the time\ninitSession is always called, whether or not the user clicked on a Branch link. If no Branch link was clicked, params will come back empty. Plan your application logic accordingly!\nNOTE If you are seeing a “Branch.h file not found” error but you’ve imported the SDK, or it’s breaking during compiling–and you’re using Xcode 6.3 or newer–click here.Branch-provided data parameters in callbackPreviously, Branch did not return any information to the app if initSession was called but the user hadn’t clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.\n  ~ denotes analytics\n  + denotes information added by Branch\n  (for the curious, $ denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)\n\n  \n    \n      Parameter\n      Meaning\n    \n    \n      ~channel\n      The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~feature\n      The feature, such as invite or share, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~tags\n      Any tags, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~campaign\n      The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~stage\n      The stage, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~creation_source\n      Where the link was created (‘API’, ‘Dashboard’, ‘SDK’, ‘iOS SDK’, ‘Android SDK’, or ‘Web SDK’)\n    \n    \n      +referrer\n      The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked\n    \n    \n      +phone_number\n      The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app\n    \n    \n      +is_first_session\n      Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)\n    \n    \n      +clicked_branch_link\n      Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session\n    \n  \nHandle Deep LinkIn order for your app to properly handle deep links, and to allow Branch to work its magic and call the deepLinkHandler, you will need to add the following code within application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation::\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {\n    // pass the url to the handle deep link call\n    if (![[Branch getInstance] handleDeepLink:url]) {\n        // do other deep link routing for the Facebook SDK, Pinterest SDK, etc\n    }\n    return YES;\n}\n\nobjective-cswiftIdentifying Your Users (Optional but recommended)If you want to know who is sharing your content, whether for internal purposes (i.e. analytics) or for customizing the experience of a user receiving a referral, you’ll want to identify your users.Branch automatically tracks unique devices. However, to make full use of our powerful API, you should also identify users with whichever form of unique identification your app uses. The usefulness of this is hard to understate. When making future queries, when scanning through data on the dashboard, and when combing through anything you choose to export, you’ll see your app’s user Id alongside the Branch-provided user Id. If you want to know that User A shared with User B, add this code.The good news is that your app only needs the addition of two lines of code.Add a setIdentity: call wherever you create or login a user.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] setIdentity:@\"1234\"]; // your app's userId\n\nobjective-cswiftNOTE: Please keep the string to less than 127 characters.Add a logout call anywhere you allow the user to logout.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] logout];\n\nobjective-cswift   Note:\nLogout should only be called when the user logs out. Calling it at other times could lead to hard-to-discover errors. Failing to call logout can likewise lead to bugs if multiple users log in on the same device.\nCreating Links Programmatically (Optional)Links are the foundation to everything Branch offers. Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. With Branch links, you can tell whether a user installed your app thanks to a Facebook ad, an email campaign or a personal invite from a friend.On the world wide web, URLs allow users to go straight to content rather than wading through an entire site. You can send your friend a link to a specific radio station – http://www.iheart.com/live/wild-949-305/ – and other users will be taken straight to that station. Branch links work the same way. The link https://bnc.lt/l/3mN6Lak-2u will open the Wild 94.9 station even if you didn’t have the app installed previously.Here’s how to create your own Branch Links.On iOS, it’s a rather simple method call.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   Data is for Deeplinking\nYou can also use the data to link directly to content! Instead of “foo”: “bar”, you could pass in “pictureId”: “1234”, then when a user clicks on a link you can open the app straight to picture with Id 1234. Keep reading…\nRouting within your iOS App (Optional)Routing to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside of the deepLinkHandler, you will want to examine the params dictionary to determine whether the user clicked on a link to content. Regardless of whether your app involves pictures, videos, text or whatever novel content your app contains, you likely have an internal system of identifiers.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures and each one is tagged with a picture Id. When a user shares a picture, simply attach a picture Id to the Branch link being created. If a user clicks a link to a specific picture, this Id will show up in the params dictionary in the deepLinkHandler.- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\n  // initialize the session, setup a deep link handler\n  [[Branch getInstance] initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions\n                          andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n\n    // start setting up the view controller hierarchy\n    UINavigationController *navC = (UINavigationController *)self.window.rootViewController;\n    UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"Main\" bundle:nil];\n    UIViewController *nextVC;\n    // If the key 'pictureId' is present in the deep link dictionary\n    // then load the picture screen with the appropriate picture\n    NSString *pictureId = [params objectForKey:@\"pictureId\"];\n    if (pictureId) {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"PicVC\"];\n      [nextVC setNextPictureId:pictureId];\n    } else {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"MainVC\"];\n    }\n    [navC setViewControllers:@[nextVC] animated:YES];\n  }];\n\n  return YES;\n}ConclusionCongratulations!

To download an open-source copy, grab the zip here.You will need to drag and drop the Branch.framework file that you downloaded into your project. Be sure that “Copy items if needed” is selected.\n        \n      You also need to import CoreTelephony. See the graphic here.   Most accurate matching\nTo get the best experience with Branch, you should import AdSupport.framework. This allows us to leverage the IDFA for more accurate matching, and we can also identify users who return later after uninstalling the app.\nBranch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to YourProject-Info.plist (Info.plist for Swift).\n  In plist file, mouse hover “Information Property List” which is the root item under the Key column.\n  After about half a second, you will see a “+” sign appear. Click it.\n  In the newly added row, fill in “branch_key” for its key, leave type as String, and enter your app key obtained in above steps in its value column.\n  Save the plist file.\nAnimated Gif\n        \n      URI SchemeTo set up your URI Scheme, you’ll need to open your project in XCode and complete the following.\n  Click on YourProject-Info.plist on the left (or in Swift, Info.plist).\n  Find URL Types and click the right arrow. (If it doesn’t exist, right click anywhere and choose Add Row. Scroll down and choose URL Types)\n  Add myapp, where myapp is a unique string for your app, as an item in URL Schemes as below:\nGo do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.The deepLinkHandler is a block of code that executes when a Branch session is successfully initialized, as well as anytime a user clicks a link to your app. This is the central place where you define how your app should respond to links.When a user clicks a Branch link and your app opens, the Branch SDK contacts the Branch servers to see whether this user opening your app is the same one who just clicked the link. If it is, then the params dictionary that you see below will be populated with any data attached to a Branch link if a user just clicked one.The initSession call is an asynchronous call and any other calls will be queued up to complete after the server returns a response.For Swift, you will need to add a bridging header in order to use Branch in your project’s files. For help on adding a bridging header, see this StackOverflow answer.There are a few pieces that must be in place. First, open your project’s AppDelegate.m (or AppDelegate.swift) file.\n  Add #import \"Branch.h\" at the top of the file (Objective-C only)\n  Find the line which reads:\n\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\nobjective-cswiftand paste the following right below it:\n\nBranch *branch = [Branch getInstance];\n[branch initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) {\n        // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n        // params will be empty if no data found\n        // ... insert custom logic here ...\n        NSLog(@\"params: %@\", params.description)\n    }\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   initSession is called 100% of the time\ninitSession is always called, whether or not the user clicked on a Branch link. If no Branch link was clicked, params will come back empty. Plan your application logic accordingly!\nNOTE If you are seeing a “Branch.h file not found” error but you’ve imported the SDK, or it’s breaking during compiling–and you’re using Xcode 6.3 or newer–click here.Branch-provided data parameters in callbackPreviously, Branch did not return any information to the app if initSession was called but the user hadn’t clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.\n  ~ denotes analytics\n  + denotes information added by Branch\n  (for the curious, $ denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)\n\n  \n    \n      Parameter\n      Meaning\n    \n    \n      ~channel\n      The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~feature\n      The feature, such as invite or share, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~tags\n      Any tags, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~campaign\n      The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~stage\n      The stage, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~creation_source\n      Where the link was created (‘API’, ‘Dashboard’, ‘SDK’, ‘iOS SDK’, ‘Android SDK’, or ‘Web SDK’)\n    \n    \n      +referrer\n      The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked\n    \n    \n      +phone_number\n      The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app\n    \n    \n      +is_first_session\n      Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)\n    \n    \n      +clicked_branch_link\n      Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session\n    \n  \nHandle Deep LinkIn order for your app to properly handle deep links, and to allow Branch to work its magic and call the deepLinkHandler, you will need to add the following code within application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation::\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {\n    // pass the url to the handle deep link call\n    if (![[Branch getInstance] handleDeepLink:url]) {\n        // do other deep link routing for the Facebook SDK, Pinterest SDK, etc\n    }\n    return YES;\n}\n\nobjective-cswiftIdentifying Your Users (Optional but recommended)If you want to know who is sharing your content, whether for internal purposes (i.e. analytics) or for customizing the experience of a user receiving a referral, you’ll want to identify your users.Branch automatically tracks unique devices. However, to make full use of our powerful API, you should also identify users with whichever form of unique identification your app uses. The usefulness of this is hard to understate. When making future queries, when scanning through data on the dashboard, and when combing through anything you choose to export, you’ll see your app’s user Id alongside the Branch-provided user Id. If you want to know that User A shared with User B, add this code.The good news is that your app only needs the addition of two lines of code.Add a setIdentity: call wherever you create or login a user.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] setIdentity:@\"1234\"]; // your app's userId\n\nobjective-cswiftNOTE: Please keep the string to less than 127 characters.Add a logout call anywhere you allow the user to logout.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] logout];\n\nobjective-cswift   Note:\nLogout should only be called when the user logs out. Calling it at other times could lead to hard-to-discover errors. Failing to call logout can likewise lead to bugs if multiple users log in on the same device.\nCreating Links Programmatically (Optional)Links are the foundation to everything Branch offers. Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. With Branch links, you can tell whether a user installed your app thanks to a Facebook ad, an email campaign or a personal invite from a friend.On the world wide web, URLs allow users to go straight to content rather than wading through an entire site. You can send your friend a link to a specific radio station – http://www.iheart.com/live/wild-949-305/ – and other users will be taken straight to that station. Branch links work the same way. The link https://bnc.lt/l/3mN6Lak-2u will open the Wild 94.9 station even if you didn’t have the app installed previously.Here’s how to create your own Branch Links.On iOS, it’s a rather simple method call.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   Data is for Deeplinking\nYou can also use the data to link directly to content! Instead of “foo”: “bar”, you could pass in “pictureId”: “1234”, then when a user clicks on a link you can open the app straight to picture with Id 1234. Keep reading…\nRouting within your iOS App (Optional)Routing to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside of the deepLinkHandler, you will want to examine the params dictionary to determine whether the user clicked on a link to content. Regardless of whether your app involves pictures, videos, text or whatever novel content your app contains, you likely have an internal system of identifiers.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures and each one is tagged with a picture Id. When a user shares a picture, simply attach a picture Id to the Branch link being created. If a user clicks a link to a specific picture, this Id will show up in the params dictionary in the deepLinkHandler.- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\n  // initialize the session, setup a deep link handler\n  [[Branch getInstance] initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions\n                          andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n\n    // start setting up the view controller hierarchy\n    UINavigationController *navC = (UINavigationController *)self.window.rootViewController;\n    UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"Main\" bundle:nil];\n    UIViewController *nextVC;\n    // If the key 'pictureId' is present in the deep link dictionary\n    // then load the picture screen with the appropriate picture\n    NSString *pictureId = [params objectForKey:@\"pictureId\"];\n    if (pictureId) {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"PicVC\"];\n      [nextVC setNextPictureId:pictureId];\n    } else {\n      nextVC = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"MainVC\"];\n    }\n    [navC setViewControllers:@[nextVC] animated:YES];\n  }];\n\n  return YES;\n}ConclusionCongratulations!

To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For iOS apps, the URI scheme can be specified in the .plist file under URL Types. If you haven’t added one to your iOS app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard!

However, to make full use of our powerful API, you should also identify users with whichever form of unique identification your app uses. The usefulness of this is hard to understate. When making future queries, when scanning through data on the dashboard, and when combing through anything you choose to export, you’ll see your app’s user Id alongside the Branch-provided user Id. If you want to know that User A shared with User B, add this code.The good news is that your app only needs the addition of two lines of code.Add a setIdentity: call wherever you create or login a user.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] setIdentity:@\"1234\"]; // your app's userId\n\nobjective-cswiftNOTE: Please keep the string to less than 127 characters.Add a logout call anywhere you allow the user to logout.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] logout];\n\nobjective-cswift   Note:\nLogout should only be called when the user logs out. Calling it at other times could lead to hard-to-discover errors. Failing to call logout can likewise lead to bugs if multiple users log in on the same device.\nCreating Links Programmatically (Optional)Links are the foundation to everything Branch offers. Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. With Branch links, you can tell whether a user installed your app thanks to a Facebook ad, an email campaign or a personal invite from a friend.On the world wide web, URLs allow users to go straight to content rather than wading through an entire site. You can send your friend a link to a specific radio station – http://www.iheart.com/live/wild-949-305/ – and other users will be taken straight to that station. Branch links work the same way. The link https://bnc.lt/l/3mN6Lak-2u will open the Wild 94.9 station even if you didn’t have the app installed previously.Here’s how to create your own Branch Links.On iOS, it’s a rather simple method call.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   Data is for Deeplinking\nYou can also use the data to link directly to content!

If you haven’t created an account before, you should sign up and complete the basic setup. If you’ve signed up already, navigate to the Summary page and click the dropdown button in the top right. Choose “Create new app.” You will be prompted to enter a name for your new app. Do so and press “Create.”Web URL\n        \n      This is where we will take users who click a Branch link if we don’t know where else to take them. For example, if you don’t have an Android app released yet, Android users will be taken to this link. Don’t forget to Save!To configure the Web URL on an existing app, you will need to navigate to the Settings > Link Settings page on the Dashboard. Scroll down to Default URL and enter your website.   Tip:\nYou can customize this fallback URL on a per-platform or even per-link basis. After completing setup, you may want to check out our section on Custom Redirects.\nPlay Store or custom URL\n        \n      Part of the magic of Branch Links is that you can have different configurations for iOS, Android, Fire… – and it just works! In this section, you need to specify where the user can download your app.When setting up an Android app, you need to locate your app in the Play Store. Start typing the name of your app and it should show up in the box.You may be wondering–what if I can’t find my app, or it isn’t on the Play Store yet? Good news: you can specify any location you want. For Android Apps, you can specify the URL of your APK file. Hosting on Dropbox or crashlytics works fine, just as long as it’s the .apk itself you’re linking to. For Android, we require the package name appended to this custom URL as we set the intent accordingly and allow a deeplink simulation whether it’s the first download or any consequent deeplink to a non play-store URL.   Note:\nThis field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works). Please be sure to enter your package name as well! Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the Play Store, it will go to this URL. Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Eclipse or Android Studio.\nURI Scheme\n        \n      Setting the URI scheme is not strictly required if you are only going to use Branch to measure the number of clicks for a given link. To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For Android apps, the URI scheme can be specified in your project’s manifest file. If you haven’t added one to your Android app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard.Configuring your Android appInstalling the SDKFor Android, the easiest way to add the SDK to your project is by adding the Branch SDK inside your project structure as a library dependency. Here are the steps:\n  Right click on the main module within your project (this is called ‘app’ by default).\n  Select Open Module Settings.\n  Within the Dependencies tab, click the + button at the bottom of the window and select Library Dependency.\n  Type branch, and hit the enter key to search Maven Central for the Branch SDK Library.\n  Select the latest io.branch.sdk.android:library item listed.\nIn case you’d like to use our .jar instead, here’s a link that always points to our latest.Finally, you can always clone our Android SDK project and import it into your workspace for maximum visibility.Branch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to your project workspace.\n  Navigate to to res/values/strings.xml\n  Navigate to AndroidManifest.xml and add the following <meta-data tag:\n<application>\n    <!-- Other existing entries -->\n\n    <!-- Add this meta-data below; DO NOT change the android:value -->\n    <meta-data android:name=\"io.branch.sdk.BranchKey\" android:value=\"key_live_jbgnjxvlhSb6PGH23BhO4hiflcp3y8kx\" />\n    <meta-data android:name=\"io.branch.sdk.BranchKey.test\" android:value=\"key_test_jkptOCZtmtxhOMZ11ynbXecdDCd93cbr\" />\n</application>URI SchemeOpen up Android Studio and navigate to your AndroidManifest.xml.You can register your app to respond to direct deep links (yourapp:// in a mobile browser) by adding the second intent filter block.<activity\n\tandroid:name=\"com.yourapp.SplashActivity\"\n\tandroid:label=\"@string/app_name\" >\n\t<intent-filter>\n\t\t<action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\" />\n\t</intent-filter>\n\t<!-- Add this intent filter below, and change yourapp to your app name -->\n\t<intent-filter>\n\t\t<data android:scheme=\"yourapp\" android:host=\"open\" />\n\t\t<action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" />\n\t</intent-filter>\n</activity>However, you can have many intent-filters. It all depends on how you architecht receiving intents inside your application.Go do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.NOTE This guide assumes that you’re familiar with the Android UI lifecycle. A single Branch object instance is used per Activity or Fragment, so declare an object at the class-level, and you can call this in every Activity or Fragment where you need to interact with Branch; if it has already be initialised elsewhere in your app, the same instance will be returned.Inside your onStart, do the following, where the variable branch is created in your base activity class (of type Branch).@Override\nprotected void onStart() {\n    super.onStart();\n    Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());\n    branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {\n            if (error == null) {\n                // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n                // params will be empty if no data found\n                // ... insert custom logic here ...\n            } else {\n                Log.i(\"MyApp\", error.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n    }, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n}Next, you’ll need to hook into the onNewIntent method specified inside the Activity lifecycle and set the intent. This is required for conformity with Facebook’s AppLinks. Verify that the activity you’re implementing has launchMode set to singleTask inside the Manifest declaration. Once that’d done, go to said activity and do something like the folllowing:@Override\npublic void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {\n    this.setIntent(intent);\n}Side note: This is a requirement because of the new Facebook AppLinks change. Facebook doesn’t open up the browser anymore and just calls the URI to open the app directly. This prevented Branch clicks from being registered. To support it, we pass that link click id through the URI scheme to Branch, and send that back to the app, creating a ‘click’ without actually seeing a click. Android does a very poor job of clearing out intents that were previously called, so this helps ensure that once a URI scheme is called and consumed, it won’t trigger deep linking anymore.branch.initSession(branchReferralInitListener, this.getIntent().getData(), this);NOTE if you’re calling this inside a fragment, please use getActivity() instead of passing in this. Also, this.getIntent().getData() refers to the data associated with an incoming intent.Branch-provided data parameters in callbackPreviously, Branch did not return any information to the app if initSession was called but the user hadn’t clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.\n  ~ denotes analytics\n  + denotes information added by Branch\n  (for the curious, $ denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)\n\n  \n    \n      Parameter\n      Meaning\n    \n    \n      ~channel\n      The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~feature\n      The feature, such as invite or share, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~tags\n      Any tags, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~campaign\n      The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~stage\n      The stage, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~creation_source\n      Where the link was created (‘API’, ‘Dashboard’, ‘SDK’, ‘iOS SDK’, ‘Android SDK’, or ‘Web SDK’)\n    \n    \n      +referrer\n      The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked\n    \n    \n      +phone_number\n      The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app\n    \n    \n      +is_first_session\n      Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)\n    \n    \n      +clicked_branch_link\n      Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session\n    \n  \nAutomatic Session ManagementStarting from Branch SDK version 1.5.7, there is no need for initialising and closing session with the new automatic session management. Automatic session management can work only with API level 14 and above, so make sure that your minSdkVersion is 14 or above.Requirement<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=\"14\" />Once you do any of the below, there is no need to close or init sessions in your Activities. Branch SDK will do all that for you. You can get your Branch instance at any time as follows.Branch branch = Branch.getInstance();Branch SDK can do session management for you if you do one of the following:Common: you do not use Application classIf you are not creating or using an Application class throughout your project, all you need to do is declare BranchApp as your application class in your manifest.<application android:name=\"io.branch.referal.BranchApp\">Rarer: you already use the Application classIf you already have an Application class then extend your application class with BranchApp.public class YourApplication extends BranchAppVery rare: you already use and extend the Application classIf you already have an Application class and don’t want to extend it from BranchApp then create a Branch instance in your Application’s onCreate() method.public void onCreate() {\n    super.onCreate();\n    if (!BuildConfig.DEBUG) {\n        Branch.getInstance(this);\n    } else {\n        Branch.getTestInstance(this);\n    }\n}Close session (session tracking to support for minSdkVersion < 14)Note: There is no need to use this method if you use automatic session management as described above and only support minSdkVersion >= 14Required: Every activity that will use Branch in some way should include Branch SDK methods in both onStart() and onStop(). Don’t forget closeSession() in every activity with Branch!@Override\nprotected void onStop() {\n    super.onStop();\n    branch.closeSession();\n}Handle Deep LinkInside Android, allow us to hook into your activities where you have declared and intent filter for deeplinking. During the onCreate portion of execution, you can add something like the following:branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener() {\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tIterator<?> keys = referringParams.keys();\n\t\t\twhile (keys.hasNext()) {\n\t\t\t\tString key = (String) keys.next();\n\t\t\t\tLog.i(\"Branch Link\", key + \", \" + referringParams.getString(key));\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t// iterate through keys and start an Activity.\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t} catch (JSONException e) {\n\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}, this.getIntent().getData(), this);Identifying Your Users (Optional but recommended)If you want to know who is sharing your content, whether for internal purposes (i.e. analytics) or for customizing the experience of a user receiving a referral, you’ll want to identify your users.Branch automatically tracks unique devices. However, to make full use of our powerful API, you should also identify users with whichever form of unique identification your app uses. The usefulness of this is hard to understate. When making future queries, when scanning through data on the dashboard, and when combing through anything you choose to export, you’ll see your app’s user Id alongside the Branch-provided user Id. If you want to know that User A shared with User B, add this code.The good news is that your app only needs the addition of two lines of code.Invoke the setIdentity call whenever you create or login a user.Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext()).setIdentity(\"your user identity\");NOTE: Please keep the string to less than 127 characters.Add a logout call anywhere you allow the user to logout.Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext()).logout();   Note:\nLogout should only be called when the user logs out. Calling it at other times could lead to hard-to-discover errors. Failing to call logout can likewise lead to bugs if multiple users log in on the same device.\nCreating Links Programmatically (Optional)Links are the foundation to everything Branch offers. Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. With Branch links, you can tell whether a user installed your app thanks to a Facebook ad, an email campaign or a personal invite from a friend.On the world wide web, URLs allow users to go straight to content rather than wading through an entire site. You can send your friend a link to a specific radio station – http://www.iheart.com/live/wild-949-305/ – and other users will be taken straight to that station. Branch links work the same way. The link https://bnc.lt/l/3mN6Lak-2u will open the Wild 94.9 station even if you didn’t have the app installed previously.Here’s how to create your own Branch Links.JSONObject obj = new JSONObject(); obj.putString(\"foo\", \"bar\");\nbranch.getShortUrl(obj, new BranchLinkCreateListener() {\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onLinkCreate(String url, BranchError error) {\n\t\tLog.i(TAG, \"Ready to share my link = \" + url);\n\t}\n});   Data is for Deeplinking\nYou can also use the data to link directly to content! Instead of “foo”: “bar”, you could pass in “picture_id”: “1234”, then when a user clicks on a link you can open the app straight to picture with Id 1234. Keep reading…\nRouting within your Android App (Optional)Routing to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside onStart, when Branch is initialized, you will want to examine the dictionary we pass to you from our callback. This will allow you to know whether or not a link click with context was made. You’ll likely have many entry points based off different parameters.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures, and each picture has an ID. When user A decides to share a picture, attach that ID to the shortUrl or LongURL being created. When User B downloads (or opens the app if they already have it), the call to initSession will inform you of the parameters user A sent. Unpack em, and route away to the right view!@Override\npublic void onStart() {\n    super.onStart();\n\n    Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());\n    branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, Branch.BranchError error) {\n            if (error == null) {\n                // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked before showing up\n                // params will be empty if no data found\n                String pictureID = referringParams.optString(\"picture_id\", \"\");\n                if (pictureID.equals(\"\")) {\n                    startActivity(new Intent(this, HomeActivity.class));\n                }\n                else {\n                    Intent i = new Intent(this, ViewerActivity.class);\n                    i.putExtra(\"picture_id\", pictureID);\n                    startActivity(i);\n                }\n            } else {\n                Log.e(\"MyApp\", error.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n    }, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n    // if you want to specify isReferrable, then comment out the above line and uncomment this line:\n    // }, true, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n}ConclusionCongratulations! You’re now up and running with Branch. To finish up, we’ll walk you through the data you’re seeing in your dashboard in Link and Install Attribution.Questions, comments and love letters are always welcome at support@branchmetrics.io."},{"title":"   Skip a beat","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/quickstart_guide/android/","body":"If you’ve completed Your first marketing link then you can skip straight down to URI Scheme"},{"title":"Configuring the Dashboard for your Android app","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/quickstart_guide/android/#configuring-the-dashboard-for-your-android-app","body":""},{"title":"App Name","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/quickstart_guide/android/#app-name","body":"To get started, point your browser to https://dashboard.branch.io/.

For example, if you don’t have an Android app released yet, Android users will be taken to this link. Don’t forget to Save!To configure the Web URL on an existing app, you will need to navigate to the Settings > Link Settings page on the Dashboard. Scroll down to Default URL and enter your website.   Tip:\nYou can customize this fallback URL on a per-platform or even per-link basis. After completing setup, you may want to check out our section on Custom Redirects.\nPlay Store or custom URL\n        \n      Part of the magic of Branch Links is that you can have different configurations for iOS, Android, Fire… – and it just works! In this section, you need to specify where the user can download your app.When setting up an Android app, you need to locate your app in the Play Store. Start typing the name of your app and it should show up in the box.You may be wondering–what if I can’t find my app, or it isn’t on the Play Store yet? Good news: you can specify any location you want. For Android Apps, you can specify the URL of your APK file. Hosting on Dropbox or crashlytics works fine, just as long as it’s the .apk itself you’re linking to. For Android, we require the package name appended to this custom URL as we set the intent accordingly and allow a deeplink simulation whether it’s the first download or any consequent deeplink to a non play-store URL.   Note:\nThis field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works). Please be sure to enter your package name as well! Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the Play Store, it will go to this URL. Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Eclipse or Android Studio.\nURI Scheme\n        \n      Setting the URI scheme is not strictly required if you are only going to use Branch to measure the number of clicks for a given link. To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For Android apps, the URI scheme can be specified in your project’s manifest file. If you haven’t added one to your Android app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard.Configuring your Android appInstalling the SDKFor Android, the easiest way to add the SDK to your project is by adding the Branch SDK inside your project structure as a library dependency. Here are the steps:\n  Right click on the main module within your project (this is called ‘app’ by default).\n  Select Open Module Settings.\n  Within the Dependencies tab, click the + button at the bottom of the window and select Library Dependency.\n  Type branch, and hit the enter key to search Maven Central for the Branch SDK Library.\n  Select the latest io.branch.sdk.android:library item listed.\nIn case you’d like to use our .jar instead, here’s a link that always points to our latest.Finally, you can always clone our Android SDK project and import it into your workspace for maximum visibility.Branch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to your project workspace.\n  Navigate to to res/values/strings.xml\n  Navigate to AndroidManifest.xml and add the following <meta-data tag:\n<application>\n    <!-- Other existing entries -->\n\n    <!-- Add this meta-data below; DO NOT change the android:value -->\n    <meta-data android:name=\"io.branch.sdk.BranchKey\" android:value=\"key_live_jbgnjxvlhSb6PGH23BhO4hiflcp3y8kx\" />\n    <meta-data android:name=\"io.branch.sdk.BranchKey.test\" android:value=\"key_test_jkptOCZtmtxhOMZ11ynbXecdDCd93cbr\" />\n</application>URI SchemeOpen up Android Studio and navigate to your AndroidManifest.xml.You can register your app to respond to direct deep links (yourapp:// in a mobile browser) by adding the second intent filter block.<activity\n\tandroid:name=\"com.yourapp.SplashActivity\"\n\tandroid:label=\"@string/app_name\" >\n\t<intent-filter>\n\t\t<action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\" />\n\t</intent-filter>\n\t<!-- Add this intent filter below, and change yourapp to your app name -->\n\t<intent-filter>\n\t\t<data android:scheme=\"yourapp\" android:host=\"open\" />\n\t\t<action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" />\n\t</intent-filter>\n</activity>However, you can have many intent-filters. It all depends on how you architecht receiving intents inside your application.Go do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.NOTE This guide assumes that you’re familiar with the Android UI lifecycle. A single Branch object instance is used per Activity or Fragment, so declare an object at the class-level, and you can call this in every Activity or Fragment where you need to interact with Branch; if it has already be initialised elsewhere in your app, the same instance will be returned.Inside your onStart, do the following, where the variable branch is created in your base activity class (of type Branch).@Override\nprotected void onStart() {\n    super.onStart();\n    Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());\n    branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {\n            if (error == null) {\n                // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n                // params will be empty if no data found\n                // ... insert custom logic here ...\n            } else {\n                Log.i(\"MyApp\", error.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n    }, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n}Next, you’ll need to hook into the onNewIntent method specified inside the Activity lifecycle and set the intent. This is required for conformity with Facebook’s AppLinks. Verify that the activity you’re implementing has launchMode set to singleTask inside the Manifest declaration. Once that’d done, go to said activity and do something like the folllowing:@Override\npublic void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {\n    this.setIntent(intent);\n}Side note: This is a requirement because of the new Facebook AppLinks change. Facebook doesn’t open up the browser anymore and just calls the URI to open the app directly. This prevented Branch clicks from being registered. To support it, we pass that link click id through the URI scheme to Branch, and send that back to the app, creating a ‘click’ without actually seeing a click. Android does a very poor job of clearing out intents that were previously called, so this helps ensure that once a URI scheme is called and consumed, it won’t trigger deep linking anymore.branch.initSession(branchReferralInitListener, this.getIntent().getData(), this);NOTE if you’re calling this inside a fragment, please use getActivity() instead of passing in this. Also, this.getIntent().getData() refers to the data associated with an incoming intent.Branch-provided data parameters in callbackPreviously, Branch did not return any information to the app if initSession was called but the user hadn’t clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.\n  ~ denotes analytics\n  + denotes information added by Branch\n  (for the curious, $ denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)\n\n  \n    \n      Parameter\n      Meaning\n    \n    \n      ~channel\n      The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~feature\n      The feature, such as invite or share, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~tags\n      Any tags, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~campaign\n      The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~stage\n      The stage, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~creation_source\n      Where the link was created (‘API’, ‘Dashboard’, ‘SDK’, ‘iOS SDK’, ‘Android SDK’, or ‘Web SDK’)\n    \n    \n      +referrer\n      The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked\n    \n    \n      +phone_number\n      The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app\n    \n    \n      +is_first_session\n      Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)\n    \n    \n      +clicked_branch_link\n      Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session\n    \n  \nAutomatic Session ManagementStarting from Branch SDK version 1.5.7, there is no need for initialising and closing session with the new automatic session management. Automatic session management can work only with API level 14 and above, so make sure that your minSdkVersion is 14 or above.Requirement<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=\"14\" />Once you do any of the below, there is no need to close or init sessions in your Activities. Branch SDK will do all that for you. You can get your Branch instance at any time as follows.Branch branch = Branch.getInstance();Branch SDK can do session management for you if you do one of the following:Common: you do not use Application classIf you are not creating or using an Application class throughout your project, all you need to do is declare BranchApp as your application class in your manifest.<application android:name=\"io.branch.referal.BranchApp\">Rarer: you already use the Application classIf you already have an Application class then extend your application class with BranchApp.public class YourApplication extends BranchAppVery rare: you already use and extend the Application classIf you already have an Application class and don’t want to extend it from BranchApp then create a Branch instance in your Application’s onCreate() method.public void onCreate() {\n    super.onCreate();\n    if (!BuildConfig.DEBUG) {\n        Branch.getInstance(this);\n    } else {\n        Branch.getTestInstance(this);\n    }\n}Close session (session tracking to support for minSdkVersion < 14)Note: There is no need to use this method if you use automatic session management as described above and only support minSdkVersion >= 14Required: Every activity that will use Branch in some way should include Branch SDK methods in both onStart() and onStop(). Don’t forget closeSession() in every activity with Branch!@Override\nprotected void onStop() {\n    super.onStop();\n    branch.closeSession();\n}Handle Deep LinkInside Android, allow us to hook into your activities where you have declared and intent filter for deeplinking. During the onCreate portion of execution, you can add something like the following:branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener() {\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tIterator<?> keys = referringParams.keys();\n\t\t\twhile (keys.hasNext()) {\n\t\t\t\tString key = (String) keys.next();\n\t\t\t\tLog.i(\"Branch Link\", key + \", \" + referringParams.getString(key));\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t// iterate through keys and start an Activity.\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t} catch (JSONException e) {\n\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}, this.getIntent().getData(), this);Identifying Your Users (Optional but recommended)If you want to know who is sharing your content, whether for internal purposes (i.e. analytics) or for customizing the experience of a user receiving a referral, you’ll want to identify your users.Branch automatically tracks unique devices.

In this section, you need to specify where the user can download your app.When setting up an Android app, you need to locate your app in the Play Store. Start typing the name of your app and it should show up in the box.You may be wondering–what if I can’t find my app, or it isn’t on the Play Store yet? Good news: you can specify any location you want. For Android Apps, you can specify the URL of your APK file. Hosting on Dropbox or crashlytics works fine, just as long as it’s the .apk itself you’re linking to. For Android, we require the package name appended to this custom URL as we set the intent accordingly and allow a deeplink simulation whether it’s the first download or any consequent deeplink to a non play-store URL.   Note:\nThis field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works). Please be sure to enter your package name as well! Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the Play Store, it will go to this URL. Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Eclipse or Android Studio.\nURI Scheme\n        \n      Setting the URI scheme is not strictly required if you are only going to use Branch to measure the number of clicks for a given link. To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For Android apps, the URI scheme can be specified in your project’s manifest file. If you haven’t added one to your Android app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard.Configuring your Android appInstalling the SDKFor Android, the easiest way to add the SDK to your project is by adding the Branch SDK inside your project structure as a library dependency. Here are the steps:\n  Right click on the main module within your project (this is called ‘app’ by default).\n  Select Open Module Settings.\n  Within the Dependencies tab, click the + button at the bottom of the window and select Library Dependency.\n  Type branch, and hit the enter key to search Maven Central for the Branch SDK Library.\n  Select the latest io.branch.sdk.android:library item listed.\nIn case you’d like to use our .jar instead, here’s a link that always points to our latest.Finally, you can always clone our Android SDK project and import it into your workspace for maximum visibility.Branch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to your project workspace.\n  Navigate to to res/values/strings.xml\n  Navigate to AndroidManifest.xml and add the following <meta-data tag:\n<application>\n    <!-- Other existing entries -->\n\n    <!-- Add this meta-data below; DO NOT change the android:value -->\n    <meta-data android:name=\"io.branch.sdk.BranchKey\" android:value=\"key_live_jbgnjxvlhSb6PGH23BhO4hiflcp3y8kx\" />\n    <meta-data android:name=\"io.branch.sdk.BranchKey.test\" android:value=\"key_test_jkptOCZtmtxhOMZ11ynbXecdDCd93cbr\" />\n</application>URI SchemeOpen up Android Studio and navigate to your AndroidManifest.xml.You can register your app to respond to direct deep links (yourapp:// in a mobile browser) by adding the second intent filter block.<activity\n\tandroid:name=\"com.yourapp.SplashActivity\"\n\tandroid:label=\"@string/app_name\" >\n\t<intent-filter>\n\t\t<action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\" />\n\t</intent-filter>\n\t<!-- Add this intent filter below, and change yourapp to your app name -->\n\t<intent-filter>\n\t\t<data android:scheme=\"yourapp\" android:host=\"open\" />\n\t\t<action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" />\n\t\t<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" />\n\t</intent-filter>\n</activity>However, you can have many intent-filters. It all depends on how you architecht receiving intents inside your application.Go do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.NOTE This guide assumes that you’re familiar with the Android UI lifecycle. A single Branch object instance is used per Activity or Fragment, so declare an object at the class-level, and you can call this in every Activity or Fragment where you need to interact with Branch; if it has already be initialised elsewhere in your app, the same instance will be returned.Inside your onStart, do the following, where the variable branch is created in your base activity class (of type Branch).@Override\nprotected void onStart() {\n    super.onStart();\n    Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());\n    branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {\n            if (error == null) {\n                // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n                // params will be empty if no data found\n                // ... insert custom logic here ...\n            } else {\n                Log.i(\"MyApp\", error.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n    }, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n}Next, you’ll need to hook into the onNewIntent method specified inside the Activity lifecycle and set the intent. This is required for conformity with Facebook’s AppLinks. Verify that the activity you’re implementing has launchMode set to singleTask inside the Manifest declaration. Once that’d done, go to said activity and do something like the folllowing:@Override\npublic void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {\n    this.setIntent(intent);\n}Side note: This is a requirement because of the new Facebook AppLinks change. Facebook doesn’t open up the browser anymore and just calls the URI to open the app directly. This prevented Branch clicks from being registered. To support it, we pass that link click id through the URI scheme to Branch, and send that back to the app, creating a ‘click’ without actually seeing a click. Android does a very poor job of clearing out intents that were previously called, so this helps ensure that once a URI scheme is called and consumed, it won’t trigger deep linking anymore.branch.initSession(branchReferralInitListener, this.getIntent().getData(), this);NOTE if you’re calling this inside a fragment, please use getActivity() instead of passing in this. Also, this.getIntent().getData() refers to the data associated with an incoming intent.Branch-provided data parameters in callbackPreviously, Branch did not return any information to the app if initSession was called but the user hadn’t clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.\n  ~ denotes analytics\n  + denotes information added by Branch\n  (for the curious, $ denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)\n\n  \n    \n      Parameter\n      Meaning\n    \n    \n      ~channel\n      The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~feature\n      The feature, such as invite or share, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~tags\n      Any tags, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~campaign\n      The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~stage\n      The stage, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~creation_source\n      Where the link was created (‘API’, ‘Dashboard’, ‘SDK’, ‘iOS SDK’, ‘Android SDK’, or ‘Web SDK’)\n    \n    \n      +referrer\n      The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked\n    \n    \n      +phone_number\n      The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app\n    \n    \n      +is_first_session\n      Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)\n    \n    \n      +clicked_branch_link\n      Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session\n    \n  \nAutomatic Session ManagementStarting from Branch SDK version 1.5.7, there is no need for initialising and closing session with the new automatic session management. Automatic session management can work only with API level 14 and above, so make sure that your minSdkVersion is 14 or above.Requirement<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=\"14\" />Once you do any of the below, there is no need to close or init sessions in your Activities. Branch SDK will do all that for you. You can get your Branch instance at any time as follows.Branch branch = Branch.getInstance();Branch SDK can do session management for you if you do one of the following:Common: you do not use Application classIf you are not creating or using an Application class throughout your project, all you need to do is declare BranchApp as your application class in your manifest.<application android:name=\"io.branch.referal.BranchApp\">Rarer: you already use the Application classIf you already have an Application class then extend your application class with BranchApp.public class YourApplication extends BranchAppVery rare: you already use and extend the Application classIf you already have an Application class and don’t want to extend it from BranchApp then create a Branch instance in your Application’s onCreate() method.public void onCreate() {\n    super.onCreate();\n    if (!BuildConfig.DEBUG) {\n        Branch.getInstance(this);\n    } else {\n        Branch.getTestInstance(this);\n    }\n}Close session (session tracking to support for minSdkVersion < 14)Note: There is no need to use this method if you use automatic session management as described above and only support minSdkVersion >= 14Required: Every activity that will use Branch in some way should include Branch SDK methods in both onStart() and onStop(). Don’t forget closeSession() in every activity with Branch!@Override\nprotected void onStop() {\n    super.onStop();\n    branch.closeSession();\n}Handle Deep LinkInside Android, allow us to hook into your activities where you have declared and intent filter for deeplinking. During the onCreate portion of execution, you can add something like the following:branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener() {\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, BranchError error) {\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tIterator<?> keys = referringParams.keys();\n\t\t\twhile (keys.hasNext()) {\n\t\t\t\tString key = (String) keys.next();\n\t\t\t\tLog.i(\"Branch Link\", key + \", \" + referringParams.getString(key));\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t// iterate through keys and start an Activity.\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t} catch (JSONException e) {\n\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}, this.getIntent().getData(), this);Identifying Your Users (Optional but recommended)If you want to know who is sharing your content, whether for internal purposes (i.e. analytics) or for customizing the experience of a user receiving a referral, you’ll want to identify your users.Branch automatically tracks unique devices. However, to make full use of our powerful API, you should also identify users with whichever form of unique identification your app uses. The usefulness of this is hard to understate. When making future queries, when scanning through data on the dashboard, and when combing through anything you choose to export, you’ll see your app’s user Id alongside the Branch-provided user Id. If you want to know that User A shared with User B, add this code.The good news is that your app only needs the addition of two lines of code.Invoke the setIdentity call whenever you create or login a user.Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext()).setIdentity(\"your user identity\");NOTE: Please keep the string to less than 127 characters.Add a logout call anywhere you allow the user to logout.Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext()).logout();   Note:\nLogout should only be called when the user logs out. Calling it at other times could lead to hard-to-discover errors. Failing to call logout can likewise lead to bugs if multiple users log in on the same device.\nCreating Links Programmatically (Optional)Links are the foundation to everything Branch offers. Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. With Branch links, you can tell whether a user installed your app thanks to a Facebook ad, an email campaign or a personal invite from a friend.On the world wide web, URLs allow users to go straight to content rather than wading through an entire site. You can send your friend a link to a specific radio station – http://www.iheart.com/live/wild-949-305/ – and other users will be taken straight to that station. Branch links work the same way. The link https://bnc.lt/l/3mN6Lak-2u will open the Wild 94.9 station even if you didn’t have the app installed previously.Here’s how to create your own Branch Links.JSONObject obj = new JSONObject(); obj.putString(\"foo\", \"bar\");\nbranch.getShortUrl(obj, new BranchLinkCreateListener() {\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onLinkCreate(String url, BranchError error) {\n\t\tLog.i(TAG, \"Ready to share my link = \" + url);\n\t}\n});   Data is for Deeplinking\nYou can also use the data to link directly to content! Instead of “foo”: “bar”, you could pass in “picture_id”: “1234”, then when a user clicks on a link you can open the app straight to picture with Id 1234. Keep reading…\nRouting within your Android App (Optional)Routing to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside onStart, when Branch is initialized, you will want to examine the dictionary we pass to you from our callback. This will allow you to know whether or not a link click with context was made. You’ll likely have many entry points based off different parameters.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures, and each picture has an ID. When user A decides to share a picture, attach that ID to the shortUrl or LongURL being created. When User B downloads (or opens the app if they already have it), the call to initSession will inform you of the parameters user A sent. Unpack em, and route away to the right view!@Override\npublic void onStart() {\n    super.onStart();\n\n    Branch branch = Branch.getInstance(getApplicationContext());\n    branch.initSession(new BranchReferralInitListener(){\n        @Override\n        public void onInitFinished(JSONObject referringParams, Branch.BranchError error) {\n            if (error == null) {\n                // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked before showing up\n                // params will be empty if no data found\n                String pictureID = referringParams.optString(\"picture_id\", \"\");\n                if (pictureID.equals(\"\")) {\n                    startActivity(new Intent(this, HomeActivity.class));\n                }\n                else {\n                    Intent i = new Intent(this, ViewerActivity.class);\n                    i.putExtra(\"picture_id\", pictureID);\n                    startActivity(i);\n                }\n            } else {\n                Log.e(\"MyApp\", error.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n    }, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n    // if you want to specify isReferrable, then comment out the above line and uncomment this line:\n    // }, true, this.getIntent().getData(), this);\n}ConclusionCongratulations!

If you haven’t created an account before, you should sign up and complete the basic setup. If you’ve signed up already, navigate to the Summary page and click the dropdown button in the top right. Choose “Create new app.” You will be prompted to enter a name for your new app. Do so and press “Create.”Web URL\n        \n      This is where we will take users who click a Branch link if we don’t know where else to take them. For example, if you don’t have an Android app released yet, Android users will be taken to this link. Don’t forget to Save!To configure the Web URL on an existing app, you will need to navigate to the Settings > Link Settings page on the Dashboard. Scroll down to Default URL and enter your website.   Tip:\nYou can customize this fallback URL on a per-platform or even per-link basis. After completing setup, you may want to check out our section on Custom Redirects.\nApp Store or custom URL\n        \n      Part of the magic of Branch Links is that you can have different configurations for iOS, Android, Fire… – and it just works! In this section, you need to specify where the user can download your app.When setting up an iOS app, you need to locate your app in the App Store. Start typing the name of your app and it should show up in the box.You may be wondering–what if I can’t find my app, or it isn’t on the App Store yet? Good news: you can specify any location you want. For iOS apps, you can put in the URL provided by Apple on iTunesConnect (if you anticipate going live soon) or you can specify a custom URL to wherever the app is hosted remotely.   Note:\nThis field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works).  Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the App Store, it will go to this URL. Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Xcode.\nURI Scheme\n        \n      Setting the URI scheme is not strictly required if you are only going to use Branch to measure the number of clicks for a given link. To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For iOS apps, the URI scheme can be specified in the .plist file under URL Types. If you haven’t added one to your iOS app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard.Configuring your iOS appInstalling the SDKFor iOS, the easiest way to install the SDK is via Cocoapods. Add pod \"Branch\" to your podfile and run pod install from the command line.However, if you don’t currently use Cocoapods, you can easily download and install our SDK. To download an open-source copy, grab the zip here.You will need to drag and drop the Branch.framework file that you downloaded into your project. Be sure that “Copy items if needed” is selected.\n        \n      You also need to import CoreTelephony. See the graphic here.   Most accurate matching\nTo get the best experience with Branch, you should import AdSupport.framework. This allows us to leverage the IDFA for more accurate matching, and we can also identify users who return later after uninstalling the app.\nBranch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to YourProject-Info.plist (Info.plist for Swift).\n  In plist file, mouse hover “Information Property List” which is the root item under the Key column.\n  After about half a second, you will see a “+” sign appear. Click it.\n  In the newly added row, fill in “branch_key” for its key, leave type as String, and enter your app key obtained in above steps in its value column.\n  Save the plist file.\nAnimated Gif\n        \n      URI SchemeTo set up your URI Scheme, you’ll need to open your project in XCode and complete the following.\n  Click on YourProject-Info.plist on the left (or in Swift, Info.plist).\n  Find URL Types and click the right arrow. (If it doesn’t exist, right click anywhere and choose Add Row. Scroll down and choose URL Types)\n  Add myapp, where myapp is a unique string for your app, as an item in URL Schemes as below:\nGo do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.The deepLinkHandler is a block of code that executes when a Branch session is successfully initialized, as well as anytime a user clicks a link to your app. This is the central place where you define how your app should respond to links.When a user clicks a Branch link and your app opens, the Branch SDK contacts the Branch servers to see whether this user opening your app is the same one who just clicked the link. If it is, then the params dictionary that you see below will be populated with any data attached to a Branch link if a user just clicked one.The initSession call is an asynchronous call and any other calls will be queued up to complete after the server returns a response.For Swift, you will need to add a bridging header in order to use Branch in your project’s files. For help on adding a bridging header, see this StackOverflow answer.There are a few pieces that must be in place. First, open your project’s AppDelegate.m (or AppDelegate.swift) file.\n  Add #import \"Branch.h\" at the top of the file (Objective-C only)\n  Find the line which reads:\n\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\nobjective-cswiftand paste the following right below it:\n\nBranch *branch = [Branch getInstance];\n[branch initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) {\n        // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n        // params will be empty if no data found\n        // ... insert custom logic here ...\n        NSLog(@\"params: %@\", params.description)\n    }\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   initSession is called 100% of the time\ninitSession is always called, whether or not the user clicked on a Branch link. If no Branch link was clicked, params will come back empty. Plan your application logic accordingly!\nNOTE If you are seeing a “Branch.h file not found” error but you’ve imported the SDK, or it’s breaking during compiling–and you’re using Xcode 6.3 or newer–click here.Branch-provided data parameters in callbackPreviously, Branch did not return any information to the app if initSession was called but the user hadn’t clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.\n  ~ denotes analytics\n  + denotes information added by Branch\n  (for the curious, $ denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)\n\n  \n    \n      Parameter\n      Meaning\n    \n    \n      ~channel\n      The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~feature\n      The feature, such as invite or share, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~tags\n      Any tags, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~campaign\n      The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~stage\n      The stage, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~creation_source\n      Where the link was created (‘API’, ‘Dashboard’, ‘SDK’, ‘iOS SDK’, ‘Android SDK’, or ‘Web SDK’)\n    \n    \n      +referrer\n      The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked\n    \n    \n      +phone_number\n      The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app\n    \n    \n      +is_first_session\n      Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)\n    \n    \n      +clicked_branch_link\n      Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session\n    \n  \nHandle Deep LinkIn order for your app to properly handle deep links, and to allow Branch to work its magic and call the deepLinkHandler, you will need to add the following code within application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation::\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {\n    // pass the url to the handle deep link call\n    if (![[Branch getInstance] handleDeepLink:url]) {\n        // do other deep link routing for the Facebook SDK, Pinterest SDK, etc\n    }\n    return YES;\n}\n\nobjective-cswiftIdentifying Your Users (Optional but recommended)If you want to know who is sharing your content, whether for internal purposes (i.e. analytics) or for customizing the experience of a user receiving a referral, you’ll want to identify your users.Branch automatically tracks unique devices. However, to make full use of our powerful API, you should also identify users with whichever form of unique identification your app uses. The usefulness of this is hard to understate. When making future queries, when scanning through data on the dashboard, and when combing through anything you choose to export, you’ll see your app’s user Id alongside the Branch-provided user Id. If you want to know that User A shared with User B, add this code.The good news is that your app only needs the addition of two lines of code.Add a setIdentity: call wherever you create or login a user.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] setIdentity:@\"1234\"]; // your app's userId\n\nobjective-cswiftNOTE: Please keep the string to less than 127 characters.Add a logout call anywhere you allow the user to logout.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] logout];\n\nobjective-cswift   Note:\nLogout should only be called when the user logs out. Calling it at other times could lead to hard-to-discover errors. Failing to call logout can likewise lead to bugs if multiple users log in on the same device.\nCreating Links Programmatically (Optional)Links are the foundation to everything Branch offers. Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. With Branch links, you can tell whether a user installed your app thanks to a Facebook ad, an email campaign or a personal invite from a friend.On the world wide web, URLs allow users to go straight to content rather than wading through an entire site. You can send your friend a link to a specific radio station – http://www.iheart.com/live/wild-949-305/ – and other users will be taken straight to that station. Branch links work the same way. The link https://bnc.lt/l/3mN6Lak-2u will open the Wild 94.9 station even if you didn’t have the app installed previously.Here’s how to create your own Branch Links.On iOS, it’s a rather simple method call.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   Data is for Deeplinking\nYou can also use the data to link directly to content! Instead of “foo”: “bar”, you could pass in “pictureId”: “1234”, then when a user clicks on a link you can open the app straight to picture with Id 1234. Keep reading…\nRouting within your iOS App (Optional)Routing to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside of the deepLinkHandler, you will want to examine the params dictionary to determine whether the user clicked on a link to content. Regardless of whether your app involves pictures, videos, text or whatever novel content your app contains, you likely have an internal system of identifiers.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures and each one is tagged with a picture Id.

For example, if you don’t have an Android app released yet, Android users will be taken to this link. Don’t forget to Save!To configure the Web URL on an existing app, you will need to navigate to the Settings > Link Settings page on the Dashboard. Scroll down to Default URL and enter your website.   Tip:\nYou can customize this fallback URL on a per-platform or even per-link basis. After completing setup, you may want to check out our section on Custom Redirects.\nApp Store or custom URL\n        \n      Part of the magic of Branch Links is that you can have different configurations for iOS, Android, Fire… – and it just works! In this section, you need to specify where the user can download your app.When setting up an iOS app, you need to locate your app in the App Store. Start typing the name of your app and it should show up in the box.You may be wondering–what if I can’t find my app, or it isn’t on the App Store yet? Good news: you can specify any location you want. For iOS apps, you can put in the URL provided by Apple on iTunesConnect (if you anticipate going live soon) or you can specify a custom URL to wherever the app is hosted remotely.   Note:\nThis field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works).  Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the App Store, it will go to this URL. Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Xcode.\nURI Scheme\n        \n      Setting the URI scheme is not strictly required if you are only going to use Branch to measure the number of clicks for a given link. To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For iOS apps, the URI scheme can be specified in the .plist file under URL Types. If you haven’t added one to your iOS app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard.Configuring your iOS appInstalling the SDKFor iOS, the easiest way to install the SDK is via Cocoapods. Add pod \"Branch\" to your podfile and run pod install from the command line.However, if you don’t currently use Cocoapods, you can easily download and install our SDK. To download an open-source copy, grab the zip here.You will need to drag and drop the Branch.framework file that you downloaded into your project. Be sure that “Copy items if needed” is selected.\n        \n      You also need to import CoreTelephony. See the graphic here.   Most accurate matching\nTo get the best experience with Branch, you should import AdSupport.framework. This allows us to leverage the IDFA for more accurate matching, and we can also identify users who return later after uninstalling the app.\nBranch KeyNow you need to add the Branch Key that you received on the Dashboard into your app.Your app key can be retrieved on the Settings page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to YourProject-Info.plist (Info.plist for Swift).\n  In plist file, mouse hover “Information Property List” which is the root item under the Key column.\n  After about half a second, you will see a “+” sign appear. Click it.\n  In the newly added row, fill in “branch_key” for its key, leave type as String, and enter your app key obtained in above steps in its value column.\n  Save the plist file.\nAnimated Gif\n        \n      URI SchemeTo set up your URI Scheme, you’ll need to open your project in XCode and complete the following.\n  Click on YourProject-Info.plist on the left (or in Swift, Info.plist).\n  Find URL Types and click the right arrow. (If it doesn’t exist, right click anywhere and choose Add Row. Scroll down and choose URL Types)\n  Add myapp, where myapp is a unique string for your app, as an item in URL Schemes as below:\nGo do a quick double-check that this is the same URI scheme listed on the Dashboard, where it should be myapp://). For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.The deepLinkHandler is a block of code that executes when a Branch session is successfully initialized, as well as anytime a user clicks a link to your app. This is the central place where you define how your app should respond to links.When a user clicks a Branch link and your app opens, the Branch SDK contacts the Branch servers to see whether this user opening your app is the same one who just clicked the link. If it is, then the params dictionary that you see below will be populated with any data attached to a Branch link if a user just clicked one.The initSession call is an asynchronous call and any other calls will be queued up to complete after the server returns a response.For Swift, you will need to add a bridging header in order to use Branch in your project’s files. For help on adding a bridging header, see this StackOverflow answer.There are a few pieces that must be in place. First, open your project’s AppDelegate.m (or AppDelegate.swift) file.\n  Add #import \"Branch.h\" at the top of the file (Objective-C only)\n  Find the line which reads:\n\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\nobjective-cswiftand paste the following right below it:\n\nBranch *branch = [Branch getInstance];\n[branch initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) {\n        // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n        // params will be empty if no data found\n        // ... insert custom logic here ...\n        NSLog(@\"params: %@\", params.description)\n    }\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   initSession is called 100% of the time\ninitSession is always called, whether or not the user clicked on a Branch link. If no Branch link was clicked, params will come back empty. Plan your application logic accordingly!\nNOTE If you are seeing a “Branch.h file not found” error but you’ve imported the SDK, or it’s breaking during compiling–and you’re using Xcode 6.3 or newer–click here.Branch-provided data parameters in callbackPreviously, Branch did not return any information to the app if initSession was called but the user hadn’t clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.\n  ~ denotes analytics\n  + denotes information added by Branch\n  (for the curious, $ denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)\n\n  \n    \n      Parameter\n      Meaning\n    \n    \n      ~channel\n      The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~feature\n      The feature, such as invite or share, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~tags\n      Any tags, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~campaign\n      The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~stage\n      The stage, specified at link creation time\n    \n    \n      ~creation_source\n      Where the link was created (‘API’, ‘Dashboard’, ‘SDK’, ‘iOS SDK’, ‘Android SDK’, or ‘Web SDK’)\n    \n    \n      +referrer\n      The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked\n    \n    \n      +phone_number\n      The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app\n    \n    \n      +is_first_session\n      Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)\n    \n    \n      +clicked_branch_link\n      Denotes whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session\n    \n  \nHandle Deep LinkIn order for your app to properly handle deep links, and to allow Branch to work its magic and call the deepLinkHandler, you will need to add the following code within application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation::\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {\n    // pass the url to the handle deep link call\n    if (![[Branch getInstance] handleDeepLink:url]) {\n        // do other deep link routing for the Facebook SDK, Pinterest SDK, etc\n    }\n    return YES;\n}\n\nobjective-cswiftIdentifying Your Users (Optional but recommended)If you want to know who is sharing your content, whether for internal purposes (i.e. analytics) or for customizing the experience of a user receiving a referral, you’ll want to identify your users.Branch automatically tracks unique devices. However, to make full use of our powerful API, you should also identify users with whichever form of unique identification your app uses. The usefulness of this is hard to understate. When making future queries, when scanning through data on the dashboard, and when combing through anything you choose to export, you’ll see your app’s user Id alongside the Branch-provided user Id. If you want to know that User A shared with User B, add this code.The good news is that your app only needs the addition of two lines of code.Add a setIdentity: call wherever you create or login a user.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] setIdentity:@\"1234\"]; // your app's userId\n\nobjective-cswiftNOTE: Please keep the string to less than 127 characters.Add a logout call anywhere you allow the user to logout.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] logout];\n\nobjective-cswift   Note:\nLogout should only be called when the user logs out. Calling it at other times could lead to hard-to-discover errors. Failing to call logout can likewise lead to bugs if multiple users log in on the same device.\nCreating Links Programmatically (Optional)Links are the foundation to everything Branch offers. Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. With Branch links, you can tell whether a user installed your app thanks to a Facebook ad, an email campaign or a personal invite from a friend.On the world wide web, URLs allow users to go straight to content rather than wading through an entire site. You can send your friend a link to a specific radio station – http://www.iheart.com/live/wild-949-305/ – and other users will be taken straight to that station. Branch links work the same way. The link https://bnc.lt/l/3mN6Lak-2u will open the Wild 94.9 station even if you didn’t have the app installed previously.Here’s how to create your own Branch Links.On iOS, it’s a rather simple method call.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   Data is for Deeplinking\nYou can also use the data to link directly to content! Instead of “foo”: “bar”, you could pass in “pictureId”: “1234”, then when a user clicks on a link you can open the app straight to picture with Id 1234. Keep reading…\nRouting within your iOS App (Optional)Routing to content is highly app-specific, since mobile apps vary widely in how they are structured. That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside of the deepLinkHandler, you will want to examine the params dictionary to determine whether the user clicked on a link to content.

To obtain the number of installs, to deeplink to your app, or to do anything else that Branch enables you to do, you need to choose a URI scheme and make sure it is consistent between the Dashboard.URI schemes are particular to the platform. For iOS apps, the URI scheme can be specified in the .plist file under URL Types. If you haven’t added one to your iOS app yet, you should choose a unique identifier for your app that no one else will use (e.g. com.yourapp://).For more details on finding/setting your URI scheme in the client, see the section below on setting the client app’s URI scheme.When you know or have decided on which URI scheme your app is going to use, add the base URL to the Branch Dashboard under Settings > Link Settings.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard."},{"title":"Configuring your iOS app","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/quickstart_guide/ios/#configuring-your-ios-app","body":""},{"title":"Installing the SDK","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/quickstart_guide/ios/#installing-the-sdk","body":"For iOS, the easiest way to install the SDK is via Cocoapods. Add pod \"Branch\" to your podfile and run pod install from the command line.However, if you don’t currently use Cocoapods, you can easily download and install our SDK. To download an open-source copy, grab the zip here.You will need to drag and drop the Branch.framework file that you downloaded into your project. Be sure that “Copy items if needed” is selected.\n        \n      You also need to import CoreTelephony. See the graphic here.

For more info on setting up a URI scheme on the Dashboard, check out the section above.Starting a Branch SessionThis is required for any SDK call. There is a lot of magic packed into the initSession call and corresponding deepLinkHandler.The deepLinkHandler is a block of code that executes when a Branch session is successfully initialized, as well as anytime a user clicks a link to your app. This is the central place where you define how your app should respond to links.When a user clicks a Branch link and your app opens, the Branch SDK contacts the Branch servers to see whether this user opening your app is the same one who just clicked the link. If it is, then the params dictionary that you see below will be populated with any data attached to a Branch link if a user just clicked one.The initSession call is an asynchronous call and any other calls will be queued up to complete after the server returns a response.For Swift, you will need to add a bridging header in order to use Branch in your project’s files. For help on adding a bridging header, see this StackOverflow answer.There are a few pieces that must be in place. First, open your project’s AppDelegate.m (or AppDelegate.swift) file.\n  Add #import \"Branch.h\" at the top of the file (Objective-C only)\n  Find the line which reads:\n\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\nobjective-cswiftand paste the following right below it:\n\nBranch *branch = [Branch getInstance];\n[branch initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions andRegisterDeepLinkHandler:^(NSDictionary *params, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) {\n        // params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked -> was re-directed to this app\n        // params will be empty if no data found\n        // ... insert custom logic here ...\n        NSLog(@\"params: %@\", params.description)\n    }\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   initSession is called 100% of the time\ninitSession is always called, whether or not the user clicked on a Branch link.

Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. With Branch links, you can tell whether a user installed your app thanks to a Facebook ad, an email campaign or a personal invite from a friend.On the world wide web, URLs allow users to go straight to content rather than wading through an entire site. You can send your friend a link to a specific radio station – http://www.iheart.com/live/wild-949-305/ – and other users will be taken straight to that station. Branch links work the same way. The link https://bnc.lt/l/3mN6Lak-2u will open the Wild 94.9 station even if you didn’t have the app installed previously.Here’s how to create your own Branch Links.On iOS, it’s a rather simple method call.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   Data is for Deeplinking\nYou can also use the data to link directly to content!

Calling it at other times could lead to hard-to-discover errors. Failing to call logout can likewise lead to bugs if multiple users log in on the same device.\nCreating Links Programmatically (Optional)Links are the foundation to everything Branch offers. Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. With Branch links, you can tell whether a user installed your app thanks to a Facebook ad, an email campaign or a personal invite from a friend.On the world wide web, URLs allow users to go straight to content rather than wading through an entire site. You can send your friend a link to a specific radio station – http://www.iheart.com/live/wild-949-305/ – and other users will be taken straight to that station. Branch links work the same way. The link https://bnc.lt/l/3mN6Lak-2u will open the Wild 94.9 station even if you didn’t have the app installed previously.Here’s how to create your own Branch Links.On iOS, it’s a rather simple method call.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswift   Data is for Deeplinking\nYou can also use the data to link directly to content! Instead of “foo”: “bar”, you could pass in “pictureId”: “1234”, then when a user clicks on a link you can open the app straight to picture with Id 1234.

That said, we want to give a concrete example of how you can use Branch links to route straight to content within your app.Inside of the deepLinkHandler, you will want to examine the params dictionary to determine whether the user clicked on a link to content. Regardless of whether your app involves pictures, videos, text or whatever novel content your app contains, you likely have an internal system of identifiers.Let’s assume your app revolves around pictures and each one is tagged with a picture Id.

If you haven’t completed those steps, please do so now.\nFor a referral system, Branch provides:\n  \n    User attribution through a tracking, download URL. In short, we tell you when an existing user–who you empower with a Branch link–drives a new install.\n  \n  \n    (optional) Custom rewarding rules tied to events (install, signup, purchase, etc) in app. We allow you to tie rewards to any events. You can reward users for referring users who not just install, but also signup, make purchases, etc.\n  \n  \n    (optional) User reward tracking/storage (integer balance). We leave the actual user facing rewarding to you, but we store how many credits have been earned through our reward rules. This makes it easy so that you can just check the balance of credits in the app from us, give the user some reward, then clear the credit balance on our server.\n  \n  \n    (optional) Credit transaction history. At any time, via API or SDK, you can retrieve the full credit history of the user.\n  \nLet’s get started!Generating LinksCreating LinksLinks are the foundation to everything Branch offers. Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. In the case of a incentivized referral program, you don’t need to attach any information. You simply need to make sure that you generate links for the user who will be sharing the link. Also, be sure that you make a setIdentity call as described above.That said, you can attach information about the user who is sharing the link. Then this information about this user–here “John” with id “1234”–is present anytime John’s friends install the app after clicking his link.On iOS, it’s a rather simple method call.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"referringUsername\":@\"John\", @\"referringUserId\":@\"1234\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswiftAgain, it’s not imperative that you attach any information to the link. As long as you made a setIdentity call, anytime this link is shared we will know whose link it is and when to attribute an install to him.Sharing Branch LinksThese links can be shared anywhere – via SMS, email, social media – you name it. If you have existing sharing functionality in place, all you need to do is insert a Branch link.If you don’t have sharing in place and want to get up and running quickly, check out the Sharing Methods section of our Content Sharing guide. We give you step-by-step instructions for sharing via SMS, email or social media.RewardsBranch allows you reward users with credits, track those credits, and redeem them when appropriate. It is a unit-less currency available to your users without you having to build a system from scratch.If you decide to track user credits through the Branch platform, then you must configure reward rules on the dashboard and tie them to events that occur in your app. Think of the system like this, your users are constantly completing a steady stream of actions in your app: install, signup, product_purchased. Using the Branch reward rules, you tie reward events to specific actions. Then, with every event that is saved in Branch, we check automatically if that event is eligible for credits based on the rules that you configured, then deposit the credits if so. It’s very powerful.Branch automatically tracks opens, installs, referred sessions and web session start. You don’t need to write any special code–as soon as you start initializing sessions and clicking on Branch links, these events are recorded.You can easily see these events by navigating the Dashboard’s Export page and clicking on Events.These three events are tied to the initSession and handleOpenURL calls.Rewarding Users\n        \n      To award users for credits, you must set up a reward rule tied to a specific events.Reward rules can be based on standard Branch-defined events like install, open and referred session. They can also be based on custom events.To add a rule, go to the Dashboard Referrals page and click the Rules tab. Click the green “+ Add a new rule” button.Let’s say you want to give 10 credits to each new user who signs up through a friend, and 5 credits to the friend who referred him or her. That can be done through a combination of (two rules.Rule 1: Rewarding the Referred User (10 Credits)\n        \n      \n  Who gets a reward: “Referred acting users”\n  How many credits the reward is: 10\n  Which bucket the credits go to: default\n  Whether the reward occurs the first time or every time: the first time\n  Which event triggers the reward: install\nBe sure to press “Add rule”!Rule 2: Rewarding the Referring User (5 Credits)\n        \n      \n  Who gets a reward: “Referring users”\n  How many credits the reward is: 5\n  Which bucket the credits go to: default\n  Whether the reward occurs the first time or every time: every time\n  Which event triggers the reward: install\nAfter adding this second rule, you should see the following:\n        \n      That’s it!   Referral attribution after install\nBy default, users only get attribution for installs if the users they refer download the app for the first time. If a user sends a link to a second user who already has the app, it doesn’t “count” as a referral. To override this behavior, check out the setting isReferrable here.\n   Testing Rewards and Reward Rules\nBecause we have rules in place to ensure Rewards can’t be gamified, we have some tips for testing considerations.\nRewards are flexibleBranch’s credit system:\n  is based on either Branch-provided events (install, open, and referred session) or any custom events you track with a userCompletedAction call.\n  allows you to define as many “virtual wallets” per user as you want. These are called buckets and if no bucket is specified, the default bucket is debited/credited.\n  has built-in functions for rewarding, checking the balance, and redeeming credits.\n  enables you to specify rewards dynamically using Reward Rules on the dashboard.\n  comes with fraud protection built in.\nViewing CreditsOnce users have credits, they should be able to redeem them.Checking the balance involves loading the most recent balance from the server and then checking the balance. These can be two separate steps but for the sake of simplicity we have combined them into one example:[[Branch getInstance] loadRewardsWithCallback:^(BOOL changed, NSError *err) {\n    if (!err) {\n        NSLog(@\"credit: %lu\", [[Branch getInstance] getCredits]);\n    }\n}];Showing ReferralsIf you’re using the Branch Invite SDK, displaying referrals, earned credits, and credit transactions to your users is super easy. It handles all the logic of determining which transactions are referrals for you as well, so there is no confusing logic. If desired, you can provide a customized view that will have the data fed into it.For the most basic integration, using the default Branch styled view, you can add the following controller, which can be shown modally or within a tab / navigation controller. Note that the delegate requires you to provide a User ID that can be used to determine transactions where the current user was the referring user.BranchReferralController *referralController = [BranchReferralController branchReferralControllerWithDelegate:self];This will appear as follows\nIf the basic styling doesn’t fit the needs of your app, you can provide an entirely custom view with just as little effort. The view should conform to the BranchReferralView protocol so that the controller can set the data items on it.BranchReferralController *referralController = [BranchReferralController branchReferralControllerWithView:myCustomView delegate:self];Redeeming CreditsWhen users spend credits, you can make a simple call to redeem their credits. On your dashboard, this will fall under the default bucket.[[Branch getInstance] redeemRewards:5 callback:^(BOOL success, NSError *error) {\n    if (success) {\n        NSLog(@\"Redeemed 5 credits!\");\n    }\n    else {\n        NSLog(@\"Failed to redeem credits: %@\", error);\n    }\n}];Redeeming FlowBuilding out a credit redemption flow is super easy and painless, but there are a few important factors to keep in mind in terms of UX.\n  Users should know their total balance before commiting to a redemption.\n  Users should be aware of how many points they are agreeing to spend.\n  Since this is a one way, non-reversable transaction, confirmation is appropriate.\n  Users should see a progress indicator so they’re aware the transaction is taking place.\n  Users should not be able to resubmit while the redemption is occuring (progress indicator can handle this).\n  Upon completion, users should receive confirmation of success, and see their updated balance.\nFortunately, this is all fairly simple to accomplish with Branch. You really only need to take four steps:\n  Ensure Credits are loaded.\n  Show a confirmation dialog before redeeming credits.\n  Call the redeemRewards method and show a progress dialog.\n  Show a completion dialog and reflect updates in balance.\n- (IBAction)redeemCredits:(id)sender {\n    [[Branch getInstance] loadRewardsWithCallback:^(BOOL changed, NSError *error) {\n        if (!error) {\n            [[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"Redeem 5 credits?\" message:nil delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@\"Cancel\" otherButtonTitles:@\"OK\", nil] show];\n        }\n    }];\n}\n\n- (void)alertView:(UIAlertView *)alertView clickedButtonAtIndex:(NSInteger)buttonIndex {\n    if (buttonIndex) {\n        [self showLoadingMask]; // impl not shown\n\n        [[Branch getInstance] redeemRewards:5 callback:^(BOOL success, NSError *error) {\n            [self hideLoadingMask]; // impl not shown\n\n            if (!err) {\n                NSInteger newBalance = [[Branch getInstance] getCredits];\n                NSString *successMsg = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"You redeemed 5 credits! You have %ld remaining.\", (long)newBalance];\n                [[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"Success\" message:successMsg delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:@\"OK\" otherButtonTitles:nil] show];\n\n                self.creditCountLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%ld credits available\", (long)newBalance]; // impl not shown\n            }\n        }];\n    }\n}Here’s a super simple example:\nFraud ProtectionWhile a bulletproof referral program is impossible, we do our best with a number of different mechanisms to stop high level fraud.\n  We track the hardware ID and IDFA of the device and tie our concept of a user identity to that identifier, preventing the cases of the same user triggering an event multiple times, and subtracting rewards when we detect fraud (multiple attempts to claim a reward from the same device).\n  Further, we merge identities so that if a user signs in on their iPhone and then their iPad using the same Facebook ID, when you let Branch know that this is the same user (via a setIdentity call), we’ll make sure any duplicate reward is removed.\nThis means that while testing you may run into issues if you test repeatedly with the same devices. When testing referral programs and reward rules, you should consider using setDebug – more on that on our “Testing your integration” page.Lastly, if you’re concerned about users gaming your system via the simulator, you can use our method isSimulator to determine whether to record an event or give a reward. It’s internal to our open-source SDK.Conclusion: So Much MoreYou now have an incentivized referral program. Like many popular promo-code systems, you can reward both the user who shares a link and the user who clicks the link and installs the app. With Branch links, the magic is built in, so there’s no need for a promo code. Because we want to empower developers, we also offer the ability to reward users with credits, track those credits and redeem them–all with a few lines of code.This guide covered the basics. The following may be of interest to you, if you want to:\n  \n    Reward users for driving installs or even custom events that you define, such as “signup” or “purchase”\n  \n  \n    Personalized welcome – tailor onboarding for your users\n  \n  \n    See a list of your top influencers whose shared links are driving the most installs\n  \n  \n    Specify the channel (Facebook, Email, etc.) or tag content as it is being shared – then you can see a breakdown of installs by tag on the Dashboard\n  \nQuestions, comments and love letters are always welcome at support@branchmetrics.io."},{"title":"   Complete the Quickstart Guide first","id":"http://dev.branch.io/recipes/referral_links_with_incentives/","body":"This guide requires you to have already completed Steps 1 and 2 of our quickstart guide, Integrating the SDK.

If you haven’t completed those steps, please do so now.\nFor a referral system, Branch provides:\n  \n    User attribution through a tracking, download URL. In short, we tell you when an existing user–who you empower with a Branch link–drives a new install.\n  \n  \n    (optional) Custom rewarding rules tied to events (install, signup, purchase, etc) in app. We allow you to tie rewards to any events. You can reward users for referring users who not just install, but also signup, make purchases, etc.\n  \n  \n    (optional) User reward tracking/storage (integer balance). We leave the actual user facing rewarding to you, but we store how many credits have been earned through our reward rules. This makes it easy so that you can just check the balance of credits in the app from us, give the user some reward, then clear the credit balance on our server.\n  \n  \n    (optional) Credit transaction history. At any time, via API or SDK, you can retrieve the full credit history of the user.\n  \nLet’s get started!Generating LinksCreating LinksLinks are the foundation to everything Branch offers. Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. In the case of a incentivized referral program, you don’t need to attach any information. You simply need to make sure that you generate links for the user who will be sharing the link. Also, be sure that you make a setIdentity call as described above.That said, you can attach information about the user who is sharing the link. Then this information about this user–here “John” with id “1234”–is present anytime John’s friends install the app after clicking his link.JSONObject obj = new JSONObject();\nobj.putString(\"referringUserName\", \"John\");\nobj.putString(\"referringUserId\", \"1234\"));\nbranch.getShortUrl(obj, new BranchLinkCreateListener() {\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onLinkCreate(String url, BranchError error) {\n\t\tLog.i(TAG, \"Ready to share my link = \" + url);\n\t}\n});Again, it’s not imperative that you attach any information to the link. As long as you made a setIdentity call, anytime this link is shared we will know whose link it is and when to attribute an install to him.Sharing Branch LinksThese links can be shared anywhere – via SMS, email, social media – you name it. If you have existing sharing functionality in place, all you need to do is insert a Branch link.RewardsBranch allows you reward users with credits, track those credits, and redeem them when appropriate. It is a unit-less currency available to your users without you having to build a system from scratch.If you decide to track user credits through the Branch platform, then you must configure reward rules on the dashboard and tie them to events that occur in your app. Think of the system like this, your users are constantly completing a steady stream of actions in your app: install, signup, product_purchased. Using the Branch reward rules, you tie reward events to specific actions. Then, with every event that is saved in Branch, we check automatically if that event is eligible for credits based on the rules that you configured, then deposit the credits if so. It’s very powerful.Branch automatically tracks opens, installs, referred sessions and web session start. You don’t need to write any special code–as soon as you start initializing sessions and clicking on Branch links, these events are recorded.You can easily see these events by navigating the Dashboard’s Export page and clicking on Events.These three events are tied to the initSession and handleOpenURL calls.Rewarding Users\n        \n      To award users for credits, you must set up a reward rule tied to a specific events.Reward rules can be based on standard Branch-defined events like install, open and referred session. They can also be based on custom events.To add a rule, go to the Dashboard Referrals page and click the Rules tab. Click the green “+ Add a new rule” button.Let’s say you want to give 10 credits to each new user who signs up through a friend, and 5 credits to the friend who referred him or her. That can be done through a combination of (two rules.Rule 1: Rewarding the Referred User (10 Credits)\n        \n      \n  Who gets a reward: “Referred acting users”\n  How many credits the reward is: 10\n  Which bucket the credits go to: default\n  Whether the reward occurs the first time or every time: the first time\n  Which event triggers the reward: install\nBe sure to press “Add rule”!Rule 2: Rewarding the Referring User (5 Credits)\n        \n      \n  Who gets a reward: “Referring users”\n  How many credits the reward is: 5\n  Which bucket the credits go to: default\n  Whether the reward occurs the first time or every time: every time\n  Which event triggers the reward: install\nAfter adding this second rule, you should see the following:\n        \n      That’s it!   Referral attribution after install\nBy default, users only get attribution for installs if the users they refer download the app for the first time. If a user sends a link to a second user who already has the app, it doesn’t “count” as a referral.

If you haven’t completed those steps, please do so now.\nFor a referral system, Branch provides:\n  \n    User attribution through a tracking, download URL. In short, we tell you when an existing user–who you empower with a Branch link–drives a new install.\n  \n  \n    (optional) Custom rewarding rules tied to events (install, signup, purchase, etc) in app. We allow you to tie rewards to any events. You can reward users for referring users who not just install, but also signup, make purchases, etc.\n  \n  \n    (optional) User reward tracking/storage (integer balance). We leave the actual user facing rewarding to you, but we store how many credits have been earned through our reward rules. This makes it easy so that you can just check the balance of credits in the app from us, give the user some reward, then clear the credit balance on our server.\n  \n  \n    (optional) Credit transaction history. At any time, via API or SDK, you can retrieve the full credit history of the user.\n  \nLet’s get started!Generating LinksCreating LinksLinks are the foundation to everything Branch offers. Branch’s links offer the ability to deep link directly to content, to pass data through the install process, and to tell where users are coming from. In the case of a incentivized referral program, you don’t need to attach any information. You simply need to make sure that you generate links for the user who will be sharing the link. Also, be sure that you make a setIdentity call as described above.That said, you can attach information about the user who is sharing the link. Then this information about this user–here “John” with id “1234”–is present anytime John’s friends install the app after clicking his link.On iOS, it’s a rather simple method call.\n\n[[Branch getInstance] getShortURLWithParams:@{@\"referringUsername\":@\"John\", @\"referringUserId\":@\"1234\"} andCallback:^(NSString *url, NSError *error) {\n    if (!error) NSLog(@\"got my Branch link to share: %@\", url);\n}];\n\nobjective-cswiftAgain, it’s not imperative that you attach any information to the link. As long as you made a setIdentity call, anytime this link is shared we will know whose link it is and when to attribute an install to him.Sharing Branch LinksThese links can be shared anywhere – via SMS, email, social media – you name it. If you have existing sharing functionality in place, all you need to do is insert a Branch link.If you don’t have sharing in place and want to get up and running quickly, check out the Sharing Methods section of our Content Sharing guide. We give you step-by-step instructions for sharing via SMS, email or social media.RewardsBranch allows you reward users with credits, track those credits, and redeem them when appropriate. It is a unit-less currency available to your users without you having to build a system from scratch.If you decide to track user credits through the Branch platform, then you must configure reward rules on the dashboard and tie them to events that occur in your app. Think of the system like this, your users are constantly completing a steady stream of actions in your app: install, signup, product_purchased. Using the Branch reward rules, you tie reward events to specific actions. Then, with every event that is saved in Branch, we check automatically if that event is eligible for credits based on the rules that you configured, then deposit the credits if so. It’s very powerful.Branch automatically tracks opens, installs, referred sessions and web session start. You don’t need to write any special code–as soon as you start initializing sessions and clicking on Branch links, these events are recorded.You can easily see these events by navigating the Dashboard’s Export page and clicking on Events.These three events are tied to the initSession and handleOpenURL calls.Rewarding Users\n        \n      To award users for credits, you must set up a reward rule tied to a specific events.Reward rules can be based on standard Branch-defined events like install, open and referred session. They can also be based on custom events.To add a rule, go to the Dashboard Referrals page and click the Rules tab. Click the green “+ Add a new rule” button.Let’s say you want to give 10 credits to each new user who signs up through a friend, and 5 credits to the friend who referred him or her. That can be done through a combination of (two rules.Rule 1: Rewarding the Referred User (10 Credits)\n        \n      \n  Who gets a reward: “Referred acting users”\n  How many credits the reward is: 10\n  Which bucket the credits go to: default\n  Whether the reward occurs the first time or every time: the first time\n  Which event triggers the reward: install\nBe sure to press “Add rule”!Rule 2: Rewarding the Referring User (5 Credits)\n        \n      \n  Who gets a reward: “Referring users”\n  How many credits the reward is: 5\n  Which bucket the credits go to: default\n  Whether the reward occurs the first time or every time: every time\n  Which event triggers the reward: install\nAfter adding this second rule, you should see the following:\n        \n      That’s it!   Referral attribution after install\nBy default, users only get attribution for installs if the users they refer download the app for the first time. If a user sends a link to a second user who already has the app, it doesn’t “count” as a referral.

It handles all the logic of determining which transactions are referrals for you as well, so there is no confusing logic. If desired, you can provide a customized view that will have the data fed into it.For the most basic integration, using the default Branch styled view, you can add the following controller, which can be shown modally or within a tab / navigation controller. Note that the delegate requires you to provide a User ID that can be used to determine transactions where the current user was the referring user.BranchReferralController *referralController = [BranchReferralController branchReferralControllerWithDelegate:self];This will appear as follows\nIf the basic styling doesn’t fit the needs of your app, you can provide an entirely custom view with just as little effort. The view should conform to the BranchReferralView protocol so that the controller can set the data items on it.BranchReferralController *referralController = [BranchReferralController branchReferralControllerWithView:myCustomView delegate:self];Redeeming CreditsWhen users spend credits, you can make a simple call to redeem their credits. On your dashboard, this will fall under the default bucket.[[Branch getInstance] redeemRewards:5 callback:^(BOOL success, NSError *error) {\n    if (success) {\n        NSLog(@\"Redeemed 5 credits!\");\n    }\n    else {\n        NSLog(@\"Failed to redeem credits: %@\", error);\n    }\n}];Redeeming FlowBuilding out a credit redemption flow is super easy and painless, but there are a few important factors to keep in mind in terms of UX.\n  Users should know their total balance before commiting to a redemption.\n  Users should be aware of how many points they are agreeing to spend.\n  Since this is a one way, non-reversable transaction, confirmation is appropriate.\n  Users should see a progress indicator so they’re aware the transaction is taking place.\n  Users should not be able to resubmit while the redemption is occuring (progress indicator can handle this).\n  Upon completion, users should receive confirmation of success, and see their updated balance.\nFortunately, this is all fairly simple to accomplish with Branch.

If desired, you can provide a customized view that will have the data fed into it.For the most basic integration, using the default Branch styled view, you can add the following controller, which can be shown modally or within a tab / navigation controller. Note that the delegate requires you to provide a User ID that can be used to determine transactions where the current user was the referring user.BranchReferralController *referralController = [BranchReferralController branchReferralControllerWithDelegate:self];This will appear as follows\nIf the basic styling doesn’t fit the needs of your app, you can provide an entirely custom view with just as little effort.

The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard.Web SetupThe Branch Web SDK gives you the ability to quickly build a text-me-the-app feature. First you will need to initialize Branch via a snippet of code, then you will need to invoke the SendSMS() method when a user enters his or her phone number.Initializing Branch on Your Web PageAfter configuring your app on the Dashboard, you can simply add the following code somewhere inside the <head> </head> tags on your website. Note that the only thing you need to do is replace YOUR-BRANCH-KEY with your Branch Key inside the init() call.<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    (function(b,r,a,n,c,h,_,s,d,k){if(!b[n]||!b[n]._q){for(;s<_.length;)c(h,_[s++]);d=r.createElement(a);d.async=1;d.src=\"https://cdn.branch.io/branch-v1.5.6.min.js\";k=r.getElementsByTagName(a)[0];k.parentNode.insertBefore(d,k);b[n]=h}})(window,document,\"script\",\"branch\",function(b,r){b[r]=function(){b._q.push([r,arguments])}},{_q:[],_v:1},\"init data setIdentity logout track link sendSMS referrals credits creditHistory applyCode validateCode getCode redeem banner closeBanner\".split(\" \"),0);\n\nbranch.init('YOUR-BRANCH-KEY');\n\n</script>You can find your Branch Key on the Dashboard’s Settings page.SendSMS()You can read more about the SendSMS() method here.The main thing you need to know is that your web page should invoke this method with the following parameters:branch.sendSMS(\n    phone,\n    linkData,\n    options,\n    callback (err, data)\n);So, for example, your call to this method, once filled in with the user’s phone number, could look like the following:branch.sendSMS(\n    phone: '9999999999',\n    {\n        tags: ['tag1', 'tag2'],\n        channel: 'facebook',\n        feature: 'dashboard',\n        stage: 'new user',\n        type: 1,\n        data: {\n            foo: 'bar'\n        }\n    },\n    { make_new_link: true }, // Default: false. If set to true, sendSMS will generate a new link even if one already exists.\n    function(err) { console.log(err); }\n});It really is that simple!SendSMS() ExampleHere is a fully-functional web page that you can use as a template for your text-me-the-app page.<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html lang=\"en-US\">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n            (function(b,r,a,n,c,h,_,s,d,k){if(!b[n]||!b[n]._q){for(;s<_.length;)c(h,_[s++]);d=r.createElement(a);d.async=1;d.src=\"https://cdn.branch.io/branch-v1.4.1.min.js\";k=r.getElementsByTagName(a)[0];k.parentNode.insertBefore(d,k);b[n]=h}})(window,document,\"script\",\"branch\",function(b,r){b[r]=function(){b._q.push([r,arguments])}},{_q:[],_v:1},\"init data setIdentity logout track link sendSMS referrals credits redeem banner closeBanner\".split(\" \"),0);\n\n            branch.init('YOUR-BRANCH-KEY');\n            function sendSMS(form) {\n                var phone = form.phone.value;\n                var linkData = {\n                    tags: [],\n                    channel: 'Website',\n                    feature: 'TextMeTheApp',\n                    data: {\n                        \"foo\": \"bar\"\n                    }\n                };\n                var options = {};\n                var callback = function(err, result) {\n                    if (err) {\n                        alert(\"Sorry, something went wrong.\");\n                    }\n                    else {\n                        alert(\"SMS sent!\");\n                    }\n                };\n                branch.sendSMS(phone, linkData, options, callback);\n                form.phone.value = \"\";\n            }\n        </script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n    \tSend SMS\n        <form onsubmit=\"sendSMS(this); return false;\">\n        \t<input id=\"phone\" name=\"phone\" type=\"tel\" placeholder=\"(650) 123-4567\" />\n        \t<br/>\n        \t<input type=\"submit\"/>\n        </form>\n    </body>\n</html>Using your own SMS service (Advanced)While we provide your users the ability to text themselves the app for free – we use Twilio – you can use your own SMS service.With the sendSMS() method, we send users a link that points back to the original link they clicked that brought them to your text-me-the-app page. You can now access an equivalent link that also points back to the same link. This is provided as part of the Web SDK’s init callback and is called referring_link. See the code below:branch.init('YOUR-BRANCH-KEY', function(err, data) {\n\tconsole.log(\"data.referring_link:\", data.referring_link);\n});This referring_link will be null if the user came to the page without clicking on a Branch link. Otherwise it will be of the form bnc.lt/c/XXX – the /c/ indicates that this is not the original link but rather points back to the original link.So, to roll your own SMS service, your logic should be as follows:\n  Does referring_link exist, a.k.a. did the user end up on this text-me-the-app page because of a Branch link? If so, use this link when sending the SMS.\n  If referring_link is null, generate a new Branch link by making a call to the Web SDK’s link() method. Use this link when sending the SMS.\n   referring_link passes along your data!\nIt is essential that you use referring_link if you decide not to use our sendSMS() method to text users the app from desktop. If you generate a new link, the data from whatever link they clicked that took them to your text-me-the-app page will not be passed through to the client app upon opening.\nCustomizing SMS MessagesBranch has several options for the customization of SMS messages from the Text Me the App page.The following are the three different types of messages that can be sent:1. Link Specific MessagesYou can define a special SMS message one the individual link scale. Whether you want to switch the language of a message for a different region or include device specific date, you can specify the message in the Deep Link Data section at the bottom of the link editing screen.\n\nUse the key of $custom_sms_text and then enter your custom message in the value section. (Make sure to include the  tag in your custom message!)Example:\nThe developer of FlowerPower wants to customize the SMS messages for their app based on the country of the recipient. For each Branch link, they would specify in the deeplink data a different custom message.For ads in France:\nCliquez pour télécharger FlowerPower ici For ads in Spain:\nHaz click aquí para descargar FlowerPower For ads in Germany:\nKlicken Sie auf das FlowerPower hier herunterladen 2. Custom Default for All MessagesYou can create your own custom default message that will be sent if the specific link someone clicks doesn’t have a customized message itself. To customize the default message, edit the form under the Text me the app page tab in the general settings\t.\nExample:\nA developer wants all their links that don’t have individual customizations to have the default message of\nWoah!

The customization options are only limited to your imagination.Make sure to format the liquid tag with the link.data prefix before your key value.E.g. {{ link.data.title }}Example:\nDmitri is creating Branch links to deeplink to each of the different flowers in his app FlowerPower. He creates each link with a key/value pair of the key flower and the flower name.E.g.

Note:\nThis field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works). Please be sure to enter your package name as well!

Note:\nThis field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works). Please be sure to enter your package name as well! Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the Play Store, it will go to this URL. Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Eclipse or Android Studio.\nCustom Landing PageYou can specify where users end up when they click your links on Desktop. You can direct users to any page on your website.We recommend offering users the ability to text themselves this app. You could host a page on your website and then specify this as the default URL.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard.Web SetupThe Branch Web SDK gives you the ability to quickly build a text-me-the-app feature. First you will need to initialize Branch via a snippet of code, then you will need to invoke the SendSMS() method when a user enters his or her phone number.Initializing Branch on Your Web PageAfter configuring your app on the Dashboard, you can simply add the following code somewhere inside the <head> </head> tags on your website. Note that the only thing you need to do is replace YOUR-BRANCH-KEY with your Branch Key inside the init() call.<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    (function(b,r,a,n,c,h,_,s,d,k){if(!b[n]||!b[n]._q){for(;s<_.length;)c(h,_[s++]);d=r.createElement(a);d.async=1;d.src=\"https://cdn.branch.io/branch-v1.5.6.min.js\";k=r.getElementsByTagName(a)[0];k.parentNode.insertBefore(d,k);b[n]=h}})(window,document,\"script\",\"branch\",function(b,r){b[r]=function(){b._q.push([r,arguments])}},{_q:[],_v:1},\"init data setIdentity logout track link sendSMS referrals credits creditHistory applyCode validateCode getCode redeem banner closeBanner\".split(\" \"),0);\n\nbranch.init('YOUR-BRANCH-KEY');\n\n</script>You can find your Branch Key on the Dashboard’s Settings page.SendSMS()You can read more about the SendSMS() method here.The main thing you need to know is that your web page should invoke this method with the following parameters:branch.sendSMS(\n    phone,\n    linkData,\n    options,\n    callback (err, data)\n);So, for example, your call to this method, once filled in with the user’s phone number, could look like the following:branch.sendSMS(\n    phone: '9999999999',\n    {\n        tags: ['tag1', 'tag2'],\n        channel: 'facebook',\n        feature: 'dashboard',\n        stage: 'new user',\n        type: 1,\n        data: {\n            foo: 'bar'\n        }\n    },\n    { make_new_link: true }, // Default: false. If set to true, sendSMS will generate a new link even if one already exists.\n    function(err) { console.log(err); }\n});It really is that simple!SendSMS() ExampleHere is a fully-functional web page that you can use as a template for your text-me-the-app page.<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html lang=\"en-US\">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n            (function(b,r,a,n,c,h,_,s,d,k){if(!b[n]||!b[n]._q){for(;s<_.length;)c(h,_[s++]);d=r.createElement(a);d.async=1;d.src=\"https://cdn.branch.io/branch-v1.4.1.min.js\";k=r.getElementsByTagName(a)[0];k.parentNode.insertBefore(d,k);b[n]=h}})(window,document,\"script\",\"branch\",function(b,r){b[r]=function(){b._q.push([r,arguments])}},{_q:[],_v:1},\"init data setIdentity logout track link sendSMS referrals credits redeem banner closeBanner\".split(\" \"),0);\n\n            branch.init('YOUR-BRANCH-KEY');\n            function sendSMS(form) {\n                var phone = form.phone.value;\n                var linkData = {\n                    tags: [],\n                    channel: 'Website',\n                    feature: 'TextMeTheApp',\n                    data: {\n                        \"foo\": \"bar\"\n                    }\n                };\n                var options = {};\n                var callback = function(err, result) {\n                    if (err) {\n                        alert(\"Sorry, something went wrong.\");\n                    }\n                    else {\n                        alert(\"SMS sent!\");\n                    }\n                };\n                branch.sendSMS(phone, linkData, options, callback);\n                form.phone.value = \"\";\n            }\n        </script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n    \tSend SMS\n        <form onsubmit=\"sendSMS(this); return false;\">\n        \t<input id=\"phone\" name=\"phone\" type=\"tel\" placeholder=\"(650) 123-4567\" />\n        \t<br/>\n        \t<input type=\"submit\"/>\n        </form>\n    </body>\n</html>Using your own SMS service (Advanced)While we provide your users the ability to text themselves the app for free – we use Twilio – you can use your own SMS service.With the sendSMS() method, we send users a link that points back to the original link they clicked that brought them to your text-me-the-app page. You can now access an equivalent link that also points back to the same link. This is provided as part of the Web SDK’s init callback and is called referring_link. See the code below:branch.init('YOUR-BRANCH-KEY', function(err, data) {\n\tconsole.log(\"data.referring_link:\", data.referring_link);\n});This referring_link will be null if the user came to the page without clicking on a Branch link. Otherwise it will be of the form bnc.lt/c/XXX – the /c/ indicates that this is not the original link but rather points back to the original link.So, to roll your own SMS service, your logic should be as follows:\n  Does referring_link exist, a.k.a. did the user end up on this text-me-the-app page because of a Branch link? If so, use this link when sending the SMS.\n  If referring_link is null, generate a new Branch link by making a call to the Web SDK’s link() method. Use this link when sending the SMS.\n   referring_link passes along your data!\nIt is essential that you use referring_link if you decide not to use our sendSMS() method to text users the app from desktop. If you generate a new link, the data from whatever link they clicked that took them to your text-me-the-app page will not be passed through to the client app upon opening.\nCustomizing SMS MessagesBranch has several options for the customization of SMS messages from the Text Me the App page.The following are the three different types of messages that can be sent:1. Link Specific MessagesYou can define a special SMS message one the individual link scale. Whether you want to switch the language of a message for a different region or include device specific date, you can specify the message in the Deep Link Data section at the bottom of the link editing screen.\n\nUse the key of $custom_sms_text and then enter your custom message in the value section. (Make sure to include the  tag in your custom message!)Example:\nThe developer of FlowerPower wants to customize the SMS messages for their app based on the country of the recipient. For each Branch link, they would specify in the deeplink data a different custom message.For ads in France:\nCliquez pour télécharger FlowerPower ici For ads in Spain:\nHaz click aquí para descargar FlowerPower For ads in Germany:\nKlicken Sie auf das FlowerPower hier herunterladen 2. Custom Default for All MessagesYou can create your own custom default message that will be sent if the specific link someone clicks doesn’t have a customized message itself. To customize the default message, edit the form under the Text me the app page tab in the general settings\t.\nExample:\nA developer wants all their links that don’t have individual customizations to have the default message of\nWoah!

Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Xcode.\nCustom Landing PageYou can specify where users end up when they click your links on Desktop. You can direct users to any page on your website.We recommend offering users the ability to text themselves this app. You could host a page on your website and then specify this as the default URL.That’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard! The dashboard is incredibly powerful, so if you want to dive in deeper, definitely check out Configuring the Dashboard.Web SetupThe Branch Web SDK gives you the ability to quickly build a text-me-the-app feature. First you will need to initialize Branch via a snippet of code, then you will need to invoke the SendSMS() method when a user enters his or her phone number.Initializing Branch on Your Web PageAfter configuring your app on the Dashboard, you can simply add the following code somewhere inside the <head> </head> tags on your website. Note that the only thing you need to do is replace YOUR-BRANCH-KEY with your Branch Key inside the init() call.<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    (function(b,r,a,n,c,h,_,s,d,k){if(!b[n]||!b[n]._q){for(;s<_.length;)c(h,_[s++]);d=r.createElement(a);d.async=1;d.src=\"https://cdn.branch.io/branch-v1.5.6.min.js\";k=r.getElementsByTagName(a)[0];k.parentNode.insertBefore(d,k);b[n]=h}})(window,document,\"script\",\"branch\",function(b,r){b[r]=function(){b._q.push([r,arguments])}},{_q:[],_v:1},\"init data setIdentity logout track link sendSMS referrals credits creditHistory applyCode validateCode getCode redeem banner closeBanner\".split(\" \"),0);\n\nbranch.init('YOUR-BRANCH-KEY');\n\n</script>You can find your Branch Key on the Dashboard’s Settings page.SendSMS()You can read more about the SendSMS() method here.The main thing you need to know is that your web page should invoke this method with the following parameters:branch.sendSMS(\n    phone,\n    linkData,\n    options,\n    callback (err, data)\n);So, for example, your call to this method, once filled in with the user’s phone number, could look like the following:branch.sendSMS(\n    phone: '9999999999',\n    {\n        tags: ['tag1', 'tag2'],\n        channel: 'facebook',\n        feature: 'dashboard',\n        stage: 'new user',\n        type: 1,\n        data: {\n            foo: 'bar'\n        }\n    },\n    { make_new_link: true }, // Default: false. If set to true, sendSMS will generate a new link even if one already exists.\n    function(err) { console.log(err); }\n});It really is that simple!SendSMS() ExampleHere is a fully-functional web page that you can use as a template for your text-me-the-app page.<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html lang=\"en-US\">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n            (function(b,r,a,n,c,h,_,s,d,k){if(!b[n]||!b[n]._q){for(;s<_.length;)c(h,_[s++]);d=r.createElement(a);d.async=1;d.src=\"https://cdn.branch.io/branch-v1.4.1.min.js\";k=r.getElementsByTagName(a)[0];k.parentNode.insertBefore(d,k);b[n]=h}})(window,document,\"script\",\"branch\",function(b,r){b[r]=function(){b._q.push([r,arguments])}},{_q:[],_v:1},\"init data setIdentity logout track link sendSMS referrals credits redeem banner closeBanner\".split(\" \"),0);\n\n            branch.init('YOUR-BRANCH-KEY');\n            function sendSMS(form) {\n                var phone = form.phone.value;\n                var linkData = {\n                    tags: [],\n                    channel: 'Website',\n                    feature: 'TextMeTheApp',\n                    data: {\n                        \"foo\": \"bar\"\n                    }\n                };\n                var options = {};\n                var callback = function(err, result) {\n                    if (err) {\n                        alert(\"Sorry, something went wrong.\");\n                    }\n                    else {\n                        alert(\"SMS sent!\");\n                    }\n                };\n                branch.sendSMS(phone, linkData, options, callback);\n                form.phone.value = \"\";\n            }\n        </script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n    \tSend SMS\n        <form onsubmit=\"sendSMS(this); return false;\">\n        \t<input id=\"phone\" name=\"phone\" type=\"tel\" placeholder=\"(650) 123-4567\" />\n        \t<br/>\n        \t<input type=\"submit\"/>\n        </form>\n    </body>\n</html>Using your own SMS service (Advanced)While we provide your users the ability to text themselves the app for free – we use Twilio – you can use your own SMS service.With the sendSMS() method, we send users a link that points back to the original link they clicked that brought them to your text-me-the-app page. You can now access an equivalent link that also points back to the same link. This is provided as part of the Web SDK’s init callback and is called referring_link. See the code below:branch.init('YOUR-BRANCH-KEY', function(err, data) {\n\tconsole.log(\"data.referring_link:\", data.referring_link);\n});This referring_link will be null if the user came to the page without clicking on a Branch link. Otherwise it will be of the form bnc.lt/c/XXX – the /c/ indicates that this is not the original link but rather points back to the original link.So, to roll your own SMS service, your logic should be as follows:\n  Does referring_link exist, a.k.a. did the user end up on this text-me-the-app page because of a Branch link? If so, use this link when sending the SMS.\n  If referring_link is null, generate a new Branch link by making a call to the Web SDK’s link() method. Use this link when sending the SMS.\n   referring_link passes along your data!\nIt is essential that you use referring_link if you decide not to use our sendSMS() method to text users the app from desktop. If you generate a new link, the data from whatever link they clicked that took them to your text-me-the-app page will not be passed through to the client app upon opening.\nCustomizing SMS MessagesBranch has several options for the customization of SMS messages from the Text Me the App page.The following are the three different types of messages that can be sent:1. Link Specific MessagesYou can define a special SMS message one the individual link scale. Whether you want to switch the language of a message for a different region or include device specific date, you can specify the message in the Deep Link Data section at the bottom of the link editing screen.\n\nUse the key of $custom_sms_text and then enter your custom message in the value section. (Make sure to include the  tag in your custom message!)Example:\nThe developer of FlowerPower wants to customize the SMS messages for their app based on the country of the recipient. For each Branch link, they would specify in the deeplink data a different custom message.For ads in France:\nCliquez pour télécharger FlowerPower ici For ads in Spain:\nHaz click aquí para descargar FlowerPower For ads in Germany:\nKlicken Sie auf das FlowerPower hier herunterladen 2. Custom Default for All MessagesYou can create your own custom default message that will be sent if the specific link someone clicks doesn’t have a customized message itself. To customize the default message, edit the form under the Text me the app page tab in the general settings\t.\nExample:\nA developer wants all their links that don’t have individual customizations to have the default message of\nWoah!

The customization options are only limited to your imagination.Make sure to format the liquid tag with the link.data prefix before your key value.E.g. {{ link.data.title }}Example:\nDmitri is creating Branch links to deeplink to each of the different flowers in his app FlowerPower.

You can now access an equivalent link that also points back to the same link. This is provided as part of the Web SDK’s init callback and is called referring_link. See the code below:branch.init('YOUR-BRANCH-KEY', function(err, data) {\n\tconsole.log(\"data.referring_link:\", data.referring_link);\n});This referring_link will be null if the user came to the page without clicking on a Branch link. Otherwise it will be of the form bnc.lt/c/XXX – the /c/ indicates that this is not the original link but rather points back to the original link.So, to roll your own SMS service, your logic should be as follows:\n  Does referring_link exist, a.k.a. did the user end up on this text-me-the-app page because of a Branch link? If so, use this link when sending the SMS.\n  If referring_link is null, generate a new Branch link by making a call to the Web SDK’s link() method. Use this link when sending the SMS.\n   referring_link passes along your data!\nIt is essential that you use referring_link if you decide not to use our sendSMS() method to text users the app from desktop. If you generate a new link, the data from whatever link they clicked that took them to your text-me-the-app page will not be passed through to the client app upon opening.\nCustomizing SMS MessagesBranch has several options for the customization of SMS messages from the Text Me the App page.The following are the three different types of messages that can be sent:1. Link Specific MessagesYou can define a special SMS message one the individual link scale. Whether you want to switch the language of a message for a different region or include device specific date, you can specify the message in the Deep Link Data section at the bottom of the link editing screen.\n\nUse the key of $custom_sms_text and then enter your custom message in the value section. (Make sure to include the  tag in your custom message!)Example:\nThe developer of FlowerPower wants to customize the SMS messages for their app based on the country of the recipient. For each Branch link, they would specify in the deeplink data a different custom message.For ads in France:\nCliquez pour télécharger FlowerPower ici For ads in Spain:\nHaz click aquí para descargar FlowerPower For ads in Germany:\nKlicken Sie auf das FlowerPower hier herunterladen 2.

Tip:\nYou can customize this fallback URL on a per-platform or even per-link basis. After completing setup, you may want to check out our section on Custom Redirects.\nApp Store or custom URL\n        \n      Part of the magic of Branch Links is that you can have different configurations for iOS, Android, Fire… – and it just works! In this section, you need to specify where the user can download your app.When setting up an iOS app, you need to locate your app in the App Store. Start typing the name of your app and it should show up in the box.You may be wondering–what if I can’t find my app, or it isn’t on the App Store yet? Good news: you can specify any location you want. For iOS apps, you can put in the URL provided by Apple on iTunesConnect (if you anticipate going live soon) or you can specify a custom URL to wherever the app is hosted remotely.   Note:\nThis field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works).  Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the App Store, it will go to this URL. Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Xcode.\nThat’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard!

Visit the Dashboard’s Marketing page. Then click + Add link to get started.The minimum required information is a Link Description. Creating links is actually this simple!\n        \n      The following sections will walk through various options and their implications.One example description if you want to treat this guide is: “Marketing our launch on Facebook.”\n        \n      Tags: Channel, Campaign, Etc. (Optional – highly recommended)The more information you enter, the better you’ll be able to segment data on the Dashboard and in exports. We recommend setting Channel and Campaign. Tags allow you to easily add tags that don’t need to be categorized.\n        \n      For information of the form [key]: [value] such as “product”: “shoes”, we recommend adding them below–see Deep Link Data (Optional).Hint: Press the ‘comma’ or ‘return’ key after each tag.Custom Link Label (Optional – highly recommended)\n        \n      You can customize how your link will appear–for free!You should set this if users are going to see the link, whether on social media, in a text message, or in an email. It’s less important if this link is going to be buried behind a button or picture on a web page.

For iOS apps, you can put in the URL provided by Apple on iTunesConnect (if you anticipate going live soon) or you can specify a custom URL to wherever the app is hosted remotely.   Note:\nThis field is required. If you are in the early stages of testing, you can enter a Custom URL (http://google.com works).  Then when you click a Branch link, instead of navigating to the App Store, it will go to this URL. Then you can simulate an install by running the app from Xcode.\nThat’s the end of the required setup for the Dashboard!

Unfortunately, Facebook changed the way they handle App Links routing in the latest update on April 8ish.Two important things to do in order to properly handle deep links from Facebook\n  \n    Make sure to update the Manifest so that the Activity with the intent filter for your URI scheme has launchMode:singleTask. See example here\n  \n  \n    Make sure to add this snippet of code to the Activity registered as singleTask.\n java\n @Override\n public void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {\n     // Android makes you do this yourself for some reason, so make sure\n     // this snippet is in the Activity registered for the intent filter\n     this.setIntent(intent);\n }\n\n  \n  \n    Update the SDK to v1.4.5 or higher\n  \n"},{"title":"FAQ","id":"http://dev.branch.io/references/android_sdk/#faq","body":"1.) What if Branch goes down or there is a poor connection?At Branch, we live and breath uptime & performance. We’ve developed mechanisms internal to the SDK to deal with network issues. We always call the callbacks with the error parameter describing the issue. If the phone is in airplane mode and the connection is not available, the callbacks are called immediately. If there is a server latency, we timeout after 3 seconds and will retry 4 more times with a 3 second pause in between each. These timeouts are adjustable on the singleton instance by calling: setNetworkTimeout (ms), setRetryCount and setRetryInterval (ms).2.) How can I debug or test the SDK?Just call setDebug() after you get a reference to the Branch singleton. We’ll log all requests. More importantly, we won’t reference the hardware ID of the phone so you can register installs after uninstalling and reinstalling the app.Note: Make sure to remove this line before releasing!3.) Is there any way to start debugging dynamically?Yes. Even if you don’t call setDebug(), you can still start debugging dynamically. When you are testing your app, just put four fingers on your phone screen (or just single touch on simulator) and hold for three seconds, and you should be able to see an indication of start debug session in the log. From then on, all requests will be logged. If you have signed into our dashboard at that time and are in the “Debug” page, this will even start a remote debug session. To enable this feature, make sure you pass “this” as the third parameter when you call initSession in the Activity’s onStart().4.) Facebook deep links seem to not work?Branch uses the Facebook App Links protocol to pass the deep links through to your app from Facebook. Funny enough, if you also have a Facebook app configured in the developer portal and you choose ‘Deep link from feed’, Facebook ignores it’s own protocol. Make sure to uncheck this option in your Facebook app.5.) Why do I not see any installs after I reinstall?We do a lot of smart things to give you an accurate read on the number of installs you actually have. The most common one is associating the user with the actual hardware ID of the phone. If a user uninstalls the app, then reinstalls, we’ll know it’s the same person from before and just register the user as ‘open’ instead of an ‘install.’ To register an install on the same phone again, see FAQ #2 about debugging.6.) Chrome seems to take me to Google Play all the time. Why?Chrome is very picky about opening up the app directly. Chrome utilizes the intent system to try to open up the app, and fails back to the Play Store far too easily. Here are 3 things to verify:\n  \n    Make sure the package name for the test build matches the package registered in the Branch settings and matches the package in Google play.\n  \n  \n    Make sure the URI scheme of the test build matches the Branch settings.\n  \n  \n    Verify that you’ve added the proper host ‘open’ in the Manifest - see here\n  \n7.) Why is the most recent version of Chrome (40+) is showing me a page not found error?The Google Chrome team decided that it didn’t want to try to open up the app if a user manually entered in a link into Chrome - see the history of this issue here. The scope of the bug applies to people who copy and paste a Branch link into Chrome, whereas anyone who clicks on a link in Chrome or something that opens the link in Chrome will properly redirect.We’ve filed an issue plus documented how you can file your own with the Chrome team to get this changed.

This isn’t necessarily all S3 buckets, but we’ve noticed multiple buckets (both our own and our partners) end up on some sort of “blacklist”. This only applies to Facebook’s OG tag scraper. Sharing the pictures themselves wasn’t an issue.It sounds odd, but it resulted in these posts being marked as spam or missing the preview image. We have already pushed a change to our backend and moved all images to a new location, so any links you generate with us going forward should be good to go. Any links previously shared to Facebook may need to be scraped again via the Facebook Object Debugger–if you plan to reuse those links. Past shares are not impacted, and non-cached links are not impacted.This issue manifests itself two different ways, depending on where the page was shared. If shared on desktop, the user has to verify that they are human before posting (done by selecting certain images). If shared on mobile, no verfication is done but then the link is marked as spam and anyone clicking on the link will be warned about “Leaving Facebook”.Action: if you have images hosted on S3 that are referenced by an og:image tag, go to the Facebook Object Debugger, check the scraped information for those pages with the og:image tags, and re-scrape if necessary. If you are able to share links via desktop web without having to verify that you are a human (you’ll know), you’re not impacted. Also, consider trying to share your links then filing a bug report via the link in the screenshot below:\n        \n      Second, Facebook’s latest app update on iOS pushed some sort of change that impacts the UIActivityViewController. Facebook no longer allows NSStrings to be shared. Our Branch-provided subclass of UIActivityItemProvider returned an NSString as a placeholder, so the Facebook option stopped showing up at all in the UIActivityViewController. We just pushed a fix to the SDK so that the placeholder item is an NSURL.Related, even with an NSURL, you can no longer pre-populate text when sharing to Facebook via the UIActivityViewController. Any strings passed in will be ignored. This has apparently been a violation of Facebook’s Terms of Service but they weren’t enforcing it on iOS up until now.Action: if you use the Branch UIActivityItemProvider, update your iOS SDK to the latest version. If you use normal UIActivityItemProviders, make sure at least one of them returns an NSURL as both the placeholder and the item, otherwise your users will not be able to share to Facebook.Please let us know if you have questions – support@branchmetrics.io."},{"title":"Migration note: we’ve deprecated the use of app_id in APIs (except for the /v1/app related ones), and replaced that with the new branch_key.

Or there is a poor connection?At Branch, we live and breathe uptime and performance. Just in case, we’ve got mechanisms internal to the SDK to deal with network issues. We always call the callbacks with the error parameter describing the issue. If the phone is in airplane mode and the connection is not available, the callbacks are called immediately. If there is a server latency, we timeout after 3 seconds and will retry 4 more times with a 3 second pause in between each. These timeouts are adjustable on the singleton instance by calling setNetworkTimeout (s), setRetryCount and setRetryInterval (s).2 How can I debug/test the SDKJust call setDebug after you get a reference to the Branch singleton. We’ll log all requests. Even more importantly, we won’t reference the hardware ID of the phone so you can register installs after just uninstalling/reinstalling the app.Make sure to remove setDebug before releasing.3 Why do I not see any installs when I reinstall?We do a lot of smart things to give you an accurate read on the number of installs you actually have. The most common one is associating the user with the actual hardware ID of the phone. If a user uninstalls the app, then reinstalls, we’ll know it’s the same person from before and just register and ‘open’ instead of an ‘install’. To register an install on the same phone again, see FAQ #2 about debugging.4 Facebook deep links seem to not work?Branch uses the Facebook App Links protocol to pass the deep links through to your app from Facebook. Funny enough, if you also have a Facebook app configured in the developer portal and you choose ‘Deep link from feed’, Facebook ignores its own protocol.

Reward the original user when the invitee takes action (eg. give the original user credit when their the invitee buys something)These reward definitions are created on the dashboard, under the ‘Reward Rules’ section in the ‘Referrals’ tab on the dashboard.Warning: For a referral program, you should not use unique awards for custom events and redeem pre-identify call.

Links can be created in the following ways:\n  \n    Mobile SDKs: every time a user clicks to share or invite another user, it is best practice to create a new link for that action. That way, you can customize the post-install experience for the next generation user to the exact context of the share (whether it’s a piece of content, the sharer’s face, or other customizations).\n  \n  \n    Web SDK: similarly, you can create links on the fly on your web page that can persist data through an install of your mobile app. You can use this to build a cross-platform referral program.\n  \n  \n    HTTP API: a common use case is to batch-create links customized to each of your users for a specific campaign.\n  \n  \n    Dashboard: you can manually create custom links that can be tracked and analyzed. Additionally, we support two forms of white-labeling links:\n    \n      using a custom domain name.\n      customizing the URL path, e.g. http://bnc.lt/fall2014discount.\n    \n  \nOur smart links detect the platform a user clicks from and takes them to the appropriate content. You don’t need separate links for iOS, Android or Desktop. You just tell us where the user needs to go and we make the routing happen, ensuring that your users convert at the highest possible level."},{"title":"Bundling data with the link","id":"http://dev.branch.ioundefined","body":"In order to actually pass data “through” install, you must specify the data you wish to be present after install when creating the link. We allow you to specify a free-form key-value dictionary of data (though certain keys carry special meanings that affect the behavior of the link - read on for more about that).Examples of data often present in the dictionary includes (depending on use case):\n- referring user IDs\n- channel\n- the place in the app where the link was shared\n- the content you want the user taken to\n- amount of credits you want to award themWe do not limit the amount of data that can be stored in the link. We store it all securely and anonymously on our servers and make it available to you right after a user has installed.You can also use our tagging system to tag links across a number of different parameters for fine-grained analytics. You can tag them by: feature within the app (e.g. “referral”, “sharing”, etc.), channel on which they are shared (e.g. “twitter”, “facebook”, etc.), and place in the app (e.g. “after_level_10”, “before_signup”, etc.). That way, our dashboard can answer questions like “How did conversions of users coming from Twitter shares after purchase compare to those before purchase?”"},{"title":"Desktop behavior","id":"http://dev.branch.ioundefined","body":"\n        \n      When a user clicks on a desktop, by default, we present them with a page that allows them to resend themselves the link via SMS. We have a default design, but we can help you customize it if you would like (drop us a line for details).Alternately, you can send desktop users to another web page by specifying a value for the key “$desktop_url” when creating a link. In that case, we will redirect users to the value for that key in the link’s data dictionary.If you want your users to retain the option of sending themselves the link they clicked via SMS, you can still use our app download banner on your web page that shows an app banner with an SMS input, or you can use more advanced Web SDK JavaScript with your own HTML widget. If the user was routed to that Web SDK-enabled site from one of our links, we remember that referring link data and continue the link flow."},{"title":"iOS or Android clicks","id":"http://dev.branch.ioundefined","body":"When a user clicks a Branch link on a mobile device, there are three places they can be redirected to: (i) deeplink into the app, (ii) deeplink into the app store (retaining the data post-install), or (iii) a custom/web destination.\n  The best user experience is possible when the user can be deeplinked straight into the app. However, this is only possible under a strict set of conditions: the first time a user clicks a Branch link, and subsequently opens the app, we remember, via a combination of cookies and device fingerprints, that the user has the app\n  The Branch service needs to know your app’s deeplink URI scheme – this can be set on the dashboard\n  The user must still have the app installed\nNote that if the user clicks a direct deeplink and doesn’t have the corresponding app installed, the operating system will throw an error to the user. To avoid this terrible experience, we need to be sure to only direct deeplink when we are certain the user has the app (and even so, in the case the user has uninstalled the app, we may try to direct deeplink; in this case, even though the user may be presented with a brief error message, we take them to the App Store immediately to re-download the app).Finally, the behavior around what to do when the user does not have the app (or at least, we are unsure whether or not the user has the app) can be customized: you can set a custom “$ios_url” or “$android_url” in the link’s data dictionary, and we will route the user to the that URL instead when they don’t have the app. This is often used for apps that are hosted outside of the app stores.\n        \n      "},{"title":"Getting the parameters after install or open","id":"http://dev.branch.ioundefined","body":"Once the user has installed or opened your app, you can use the Branch SDK to retrieve the data dictionary associated with the link the user came from. You can use these parameters to route the user to the appropriate place within the app or for other analytics or messaging.Below is the whole diagram of how our links work, from start to finish. For every possible scenario, we make sure that ultimately you get the data you bundled with the link right when the app is opened so 100% of the time you take the user to the right spot in the app.\n        \n      "}]
